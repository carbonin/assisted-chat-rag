## CHAPTER 1. ABOUT THE ASSISTED INSTALLER

The Assisted Installer for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is a user-friendly installation solution offered on the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console . The Assisted Installer supports various deployment platforms with a focus on bare metal, Nutanix, vSphere, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. The Assisted Installer also supports various CPU architectures, including x86\_64, s390x (IBM Z®), arm64, and ppc64le (IBM Power®).

You can install OpenShift Container Platform on premises in a connected environment, with an optional HTTP/S proxy, for the following platforms:

- Highly available OpenShift Container Platform or single-node OpenShift cluster
- OpenShift Container Platform on bare metal or vSphere with full platform integration, or other
- virtualization platforms without integration
- Optionally, OpenShift Virtualization and Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation

## 1.1. FEATURES

The Assisted Installer provides installation functionality as a service. This software-as-a-service (SaaS) approach has the following features:

## Web interface

- You can install your cluster by using the Hybrid Cloud Console instead of creating installation configuration files manually.

## No bootstrap node

- You do not need a bootstrap node because the bootstrapping process runs on a node within the cluster.

## Streamlined installation workflow

- You do not need in-depth knowledge of OpenShift Container Platform to deploy a cluster. The Assisted Installer provides reasonable default configurations.
- You do not need to run the OpenShift Container Platform installer locally.
- You have access to the latest Assisted Installer for the latest tested z-stream releases.

## Advanced networking options

- The Assisted Installer supports IPv4 and dual stack networking with OVN only, NMStatebased static IP addressing, and an HTTP/S proxy.
- OVN is the default Container Network Interface (CNI) for OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 and later.
- SDN is supported up to OpenShift Container Platform 4.14. SDN supports IPv4 only.

## Preinstallation validation

- Before installing, the Assisted Installer checks the following configurations:

## REST API

- You can automate the installation process by using the Assisted Installer REST API.

## 1.2. OPENSHIFT CONTAINER PLATFORM HOST ARCHITECTURE: CONTROL PLANE AND COMPUTE NODES

The OpenShift Container Platform architecture allows you to select a standard Kubernetes role for each of the discovered hosts. These roles define the function of the host within the cluster. The roles can be one of the standard Kubernetes types: control plane (master) or compute (worker) .

## 1.2.1. About assigning roles to hosts

During the installation process, you can select a role for a host or configure the Assisted Installer to assign it for you. The options are as follows:

- Control plane (master) node - The control plane nodes run the services that are required to control the cluster, including the API server. The control plane schedules workloads, maintains cluster state, and ensures stability. Control plane nodes are also known as master nodes.
- Compute (worker) node - The compute nodes are responsible for executing workloads for cluster users. Compute nodes advertise their capacity, so that the control plane scheduler can identify suitable compute nodes for running pods and containers. Compute nodes are also known as worker nodes.
- Auto-assign - This option allows the Assisted Installer to automatically select a role for each of the hosts, based on detected hardware and network latency. You can change the role at any time before installation starts.

To assign a role to a host, see either of the following sections:

- Configuring hosts (Web console), step 4
- Assigning roles to hosts (Web console and API)

## 1.2.2. About specifying the number of control plane nodes for your cluster

Using a higher number of control plane (master) nodes boosts fault tolerance and availability, minimizing downtime during failures. All versions of OpenShift Container Platform support one or three control plane nodes, where one control plane node is a Single-node OpenShift cluster. From OpenShift

- Network connectivity
- Network bandwidth
- Connectivity to the registry
- Upstream DNS resolution of the domain name
- Time synchronization between cluster nodes
- Cluster node hardware
- Installation configuration parameters

Container Platform version 4.18 and later, the Assisted Installer also supports four or five control plane nodes on a bare metal or user-managed networking platform with an x86\_64 architecture. An implementation can support any number of compute nodes.

To define the required number of control plane nodes, see either of the following sections:

- Setting the cluster details (web console), step 12
- Registering a new cluster (API), step 2

## 1.2.3. About scheduling workloads on control plane nodes

Scheduling workloads to run on control plane nodes improves efficiency and maximizes resource utilization. You can enable this option during installation setup or as a postinstallation step.

Use the following guidelines to determine when to use this feature:

- single-node OpenShift or small clusters (up to four nodes): The system schedules workloads on control plane nodes by default. This setting cannot be changed.
- Medium clusters (five to ten nodes): Scheduling workloads to run on control plane nodes in addition to worker nodes is the recommended configuration.
- Large clusters (more than ten nodes): Configuring control plane nodes as schedulable is not recommended.

For instructions on configuring control plane nodes as schedulable during the installation setup, see the following sections:

- Adding hosts to the cluster (web console), step 2 .
- Scheduling workloads to run on control plane nodes (API) .

For instructions on configuring schedulable control plane nodes following an installation, see Configuring control plane nodes as schedulable  in the OpenShift Container Platform documentation.

<!-- image -->

## IMPORTANT

When you configure control plane nodes to be schedulable for workloads, an additional subscription is required for each control plane node that function as a compute (worker) node.

## 1.2.4. Role-related configuration validations

The Assisted Installer monitors the number of hosts as one of the conditions for proceding through the cluster installation stages. The logic for determining when a cluster has a sufficient number of installed hosts to proceed is as follows:

- The number of control plane (master) nodes to install must match the number of control plane nodes that the user requests.
- For compute (worker) nodes, the requirement depends on the number of compute nodes that the user requests:
- If the user requests fewer than two compute nodes, the Assisted Installer accepts any number of installed compute nodes, because the control plane nodes remain schedulable for workloads.

for workloads.

- If the user requests two or more compute nodes, the Assisted Installer installs at least two compute nodes, ensuring that the control plane nodes are not schedulable for workloads. For details, see "About scheduling workloads on control plane nodes" in this section.

This logic ensures that the cluster reaches a stable and expected state before continuing with the installation process.

## 1.2.5. Additional resources

- For detailed information on control plane and compute nodes, see OpenShift Container Platform architecture.

## 1.3. API SUPPORT POLICY

Assisted Installer APIs are supported for a minimum of three months from the announcement of deprecation.

| cluster cluster-create- params | The  high_availability_mode  field is deprecated starting from April 2025, and is planned to be removed in three months. Red Hat will provide bug fixes and support for this feature during the current release lifecycle, but this feature will no longer receive enhancements and will be removed. The alternative is to use  control_plane_count  instead. This change enables support for clusters with 4 or 5 control plane nodes, in addition to the previously supported configurations with 1 or 3 control plane nodes. The Assisted Installer supports 4 or 5 control plane nodes starting from OpenShift Container Platform version 4.18 and later. |

## 2.3. RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS

This section describes the resource requirements for different clusters and installation options.

The multicluster engine for Kubernetes requires additional resources.

If you deploy the multicluster engine with storage, such as OpenShift Data Foundation or LVM Storage, you must also assign additional resources to each node.

## 2.3.1. Multi-node cluster resource requirements

The resource requirements of a multi-node cluster depend on the installation options.

## Multi-node cluster basic installation

- Control plane nodes:
- 4 CPU cores
- 16 GB RAM
- 100 GB storage
- Compute nodes:
- 2 CPU cores
- 8 GB RAM
- 100 GB storage

<!-- image -->

## Multi-node cluster + multicluster engine

- Additional 4 CPU cores
- Additional 16 GB RAM

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

If you deploy multicluster engine without OpenShift Data Foundation, no storage is configured. You configure the storage after the installation.

## Multi-node cluster + multicluster engine + OpenShift Data Foundation or LVM Storage

- Additional 75 GB storage

## NOTE

The disks must be reasonably fast, with an etcd wal\_fsync\_duration\_seconds p99 duration that is less than 10 ms. For more information, see the Red Hat Knowledgebase solution How to Use 'fio' to Check Etcd Disk Performance in OCP.

## 2.3.2. Single-node OpenShift resource requirements

The resource requirements for single-node OpenShift depend on the installation options.

## Single-node OpenShift basic installation

- 8 CPU cores
- 16 GB RAM
- 100 GB storage

## Single-node OpenShift + multicluster engine

- Additional 8 CPU cores
- Additional 32 GB RAM

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

If you deploy multicluster engine without OpenShift Data Foundation, LVM Storage is enabled.

## Single-node OpenShift + multicluster engine + OpenShift Data Foundation or LVM Storage

- Additional 95 GB storage

## 2.4. NETWORKING REQUIREMENTS

For hosts of type VMware , set clusterSet disk.EnableUUID to TRUE , even when the platform is not vSphere.

## 2.4.1. General networking requirements

The network must meet the following requirements:

- You have configured a DHCP server or static IP addressing.
- You have opened port 6443 to allow the API URL access to the cluster using the oc CLI tool when outside the firewall.
- You have opened port 22624 in all firewalls. The Machine Config Operator (MCO) and new worker nodes use port 22624 to get the ignition data from the cluster API.
- You have opened port 443 to allow console access outside the firewall. Port 443 is also used for all ingress traffic.
- You have configured DNS to connect to the cluster API or ingress endpoints from outside the cluster.
- Optional: You have created a DNS Pointer record (PTR) for each node in the cluster if using static IP addressing.

NOTE

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

You must create a DNS PTR record to boot with a preset hostname if the hostname will not come from another source ( /etc/hosts or DHCP). Otherwise, the Assisted Installer's automatic node renaming feature will rename the nodes to their network interface MAC address.

## 2.4.2. External DNS

Installing multi-node cluster with user-managed networking requires external DNS. External DNS is not required to install multi-node clusters with cluster-managed networking or Single-node OpenShift with the Assisted Installer. Configure external DNS after installation to connect to the cluster from an external source.

External DNS requires the creation of the following record types:

- A/AAAA record for api.&lt;cluster\_name&gt;.&lt;base\_domain&gt;.
- A/AAAA record with a wildcard for *.apps.&lt;cluster\_name&gt;.&lt;base\_domain&gt;.
- A/AAAA record for each node in the cluster.

<!-- image -->

## IMPORTANT

- Do not create a wildcard, such as *.&lt;cluster\_name&gt;.&lt;base\_domain&gt;, or the installation will not proceed.
- A/AAAA record settings at top-level domain registrars can take significant time to update. Ensure the newly created DNS Records are resolving before installation to prevent installation delays.
- For DNS record examples, see Example DNS configuration .

The OpenShift Container Platform cluster's network must also meet the following requirements:

- Connectivity between all cluster nodes
- Connectivity for each node to the internet
- Access to an NTP server for time synchronization between the cluster nodes

## 2.4.2.1. Example DNS configuration

The following DNS configuration provides A and PTR record configuration examples that meet the DNS requirements for deploying OpenShift Container Platform using the Assisted Installer. The examples are not meant to recommend one DNS solution over another.

In the examples, the cluster name is ocp4 and the base domain is example.com .

## Example DNS A record configuration

The following example is a BIND zone file that shows sample A records for name resolution in a cluster installed using the Assisted Installer.

## Example DNS zone database

## 2.4.3. Networking requirements for IBM Z

In IBM Z® environments, advanced networking technologies like Original Storage Architecture (OSA), HiperSockets, and Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) require specific configurations that deviate from the standard settings used in Assisted Installer deployments. These overrides are necessary to accommodate their unique requirements and ensure a successful and efficient deployment on IBM Z®.

The following table lists the network devices that are supported for the network configuration override functionality:

| Network device                                     | z/VM          | KVM                         | LPAR Classic   | LPAR Dynamic Partition Manager (DPM)   |
|----------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| Original Storage Architecture (OSA) virtual switch | Not supported | -                           | Not supported  | Not supported                          |
| Direct attached OSA                                | Supported     | Only through a Linux bridge | Supported      | Not supported                          |

## 2.4.3.1. Configuring network overrides in IBM Z

You can specify a static IP address on IBM Z® machines that uses Logical Partition (LPAR) and z/VM. This is specially useful when the network devices do not have a static MAC address assigned to them.

If you have an existing .parm file, edit it to include the following entry:

ai.ip\_cfg\_override=1

This parameter allows the file to add the network settings to the CoreOS installer.

## Example of the .parm file

<!-- image -->

rd.neednet=1 cio\_ignore=all,!condev console=ttysclp0 coreos.live.rootfs\_url=&lt;coreos\_url&gt; 1 ip=&lt;ip&gt;::&lt;gateway&gt;:&lt;netmask&gt;:&lt;hostname&gt;::none nameserver=&lt;dns&gt; rd.znet=qeth,&lt;network\_adaptor\_range&gt;,layer2=1 rd.&lt;disk\_type&gt;=&lt;adapter&gt; 2 rd.zfcp=&lt;adapter&gt;,&lt;wwpn&gt;,&lt;lun&gt; random.trust\_cpu=on 3 zfcp.allow\_lun\_scan=0 ai.ip\_cfg\_override=1 4 ignition.firstboot ignition.platform.id=metal random.trust\_cpu=on

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- 1 For the coreos.live.rootfs\_url artifact, specify the matching rootfs artifact for the kernel and initramfs that you are booting. Only HTTP and HTTPS protocols are supported.
- 2 For installations on direct access storage devices (DASD) type disks, use rd. to specify the DASD where Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is to be installed. For installations on Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP) disks, use rd.zfcp=&lt;adapter&gt;,&lt;wwpn&gt;,&lt;lun&gt; to specify the FCP disk where RHEL is to be installed.

<!-- image -->

- 3 Specify values for adapter , wwpn , and lun as in the following example: rd.zfcp=0.0.8002,0x500507630400d1e3,0x4000404600000000 .
- 4 Specify this parameter when using an OSA network adapter or HiperSockets.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

The override parameter overrides the host's network configuration settings.

## 2.5. PREFLIGHT VALIDATIONS

The Assisted Installer ensures the cluster meets the prerequisites before installation, because it eliminates complex postinstallation troubleshooting, thereby saving significant amounts of time and effort. Before installing software on the nodes, the Assisted Installer conducts the following validations:

- Ensures network connectivity
- Ensures sufficient network bandwidth
- Ensures connectivity to the registry
- Ensures that any upstream DNS can resolve the required domain name
- Ensures time synchronization between cluster nodes
- Verifies that the cluster nodes meet the minimum hardware requirements
- Validates the installation configuration parameters

If the Assisted Installer does not successfully validate the foregoing requirements, installation will not proceed.

## 3.1.22. OpenShift Service Mesh Operator

Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh addresses a variety of problems in a microservice architecture by creating a centralized point of control in an application. It adds a transparent layer on existing distributed applications without requiring any changes to the application code.

Microservice architectures split the work of enterprise applications into modular services, which can make scaling and maintenance easier. However, as an enterprise application built on a microservice architecture grows in size and complexity, it becomes difficult to understand and manage. Service Mesh

can address those architecture problems by capturing or intercepting traffic between services and can modify, redirect, or create new requests to other services.

Service Mesh provides an easy way to create a network of deployed services that provides discovery, load balancing, service-to-service authentication, failure recovery, metrics, and monitoring. A service mesh also provides more complex operational functionality, including A/B testing, canary releases, access control, and end-to-end authentication

Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh requires the use of the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator which allows you to connect, secure, control, and observe the microservices that comprise your applications. You can also install other Operators to enhance your service mesh experience. Service mesh is based on the open source Istio project.

## 4.5. ADDING HOSTS TO THE CLUSTER

You must add one or more hosts to the cluster. Adding a host to the cluster involves generating a discovery ISO. The discovery ISO runs Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) in-memory with an agent.

IMPORTANT

<!-- image -->

## IMPORTANT

- If you are installing the IBM Z® architecture, use the following table to identify the image file type:
- ISO images are not supported for installations on IBM Z (s390x) with z/VM or logical partitioning (LPAR) nodes; use the "Booting hosts with iPXE" procedure. ISO images and iPXE are supported for installations on RHEL KVM.

| Architecture                              | Boot method   | Image type                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Logical Partition-Classic                 | iPXE          | Full image file: Download a self-contained ISO image                           |
| Logical Partition-Data Protection Manager | ISO or iPXE   | Minimal image file: Download an ISO image that fetches content when booting up |

Perform the following procedure for each host on the cluster.

## Procedure

1.  Click the Add hosts button and select the provisioning type.
- a.  Select Minimal image file: Provision with virtual media to download a smaller image that will fetch the data needed to boot. The nodes must have virtual media capability. This is the recommended method for x86\_64 and arm64 architectures.

<!-- image -->

## IMPORTANT

This option is mandatory in the following scenarios:

- If you are installing OpenShift Container Platform on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
- If you are installing OpenShift Container Platform on iSCSI boot volumes.
- b.  Select Full image file: Provision with physical media to download the larger full image. This is the recommended method for the ppc64le architecture and for the s390x architecture when installing with RHEL KVM.
- c.  Select iPXE: Provision from your network server to boot the hosts using iPXE. This is the recommended method on IBM Z® with z/VM nodes and LPAR (both static and DPM). ISO boot is the recommended method on the RHEL KVM installation.

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

If you are installing OpenShift Container Platform on RHEL KVM, in some circumstances, the VMs on the KVM host are not rebooted on first boot and need to be restarted manually.

2.  Optional: Activate the Run workloads on control plane nodes switch to schedule workloads to run on control plane nodes, in addition to the default worker nodes.

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

This option is available for clusters of five or more nodes. For clusters of under five nodes, the system runs workloads on the control plane nodes only, by default. For more details, see Configuring schedulable control plane nodes in Additional Resources .

3.  Optional: If the cluster hosts are behind a firewall that requires the use of a proxy, select Configure cluster-wide proxy settings . Enter the username, password, IP address and port for the HTTP and HTTPS URLs of the proxy server.

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

The proxy username and password must be URL-encoded.

4.  Optional: Add an SSH public key so that you can connect to the cluster nodes as the core user. Having a login to the cluster nodes can provide you with debugging information during the installation.

<!-- image -->

## IMPORTANT

Do not skip this procedure in production environments, where disaster recovery and debugging is required.

- a.  If you do not have an existing SSH key pair on your local machine, follow the steps in Generating a key pair for cluster node SSH access .
- b.  In the SSH public key field, click Browse to upload the id\_rsa.pub file containing the SSH public key. Alternatively, drag and drop the file into the field from the file manager. To see the file in the file manager, select Show hidden files in the menu.
5.  Optional: If the cluster hosts are in a network with a re-encrypting man-in-the-middle (MITM) proxy, or if the cluster needs to trust certificates for other purposes such as container image registries, select Configure cluster-wide trusted certificates . Add additional certificates in X.509 format.
6.  Configure the discovery image if needed.
7.  Optional: If you are installing on a platform and want to integrate with the platform, select Integrate with your virtualization platform . You must boot all hosts and ensure they appear in the host inventory. All the hosts must be on the same platform.
8.  Click Generate Discovery ISO or Generate Script File .
9.  Download the discovery ISO or iPXE script.
10.  Boot the host(s) with the discovery image or iPXE script.

- Adding hosts on vSphere
- About scheduling workloads on control plane nodes

## 4.6. CONFIGURING HOSTS

After booting the hosts with the discovery ISO, the hosts will appear in the table at the bottom of the page. You can optionally configure the hostname and role for each host. You can also delete a host if necessary.

## Procedure

1.  From the Options ( ⋮ ) menu for a host, select Change hostname . If necessary, enter a new name for the host and click Change . You must ensure that each host has a valid and unique hostname.

Alternatively, from the Actions list, select Change hostname to rename multiple selected hosts. In the Change Hostname dialog, type the new name and include {{n}} to make each hostname unique. Then click Change .

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

You can see the new names appearing in the Preview pane as you type. The name will be identical for all selected hosts, with the exception of a single-digit increment per host.

2.  From the Options ( ⋮ ) menu, you can select Delete host to delete a host. Click Delete to confirm the deletion.
2. Alternatively, from the Actions list, select Delete to delete multiple selected hosts at the same time. Then click Delete hosts .

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

In a regular deployment, a cluster can have three or more hosts, and at least three of these must be control plane nodes. If you delete a host that is also a control plane node, or if there are only two hosts, you will get a message saying that the system is not ready. To restore a host, you must reboot it from the discovery ISO.

3.  From the Options ( ⋮ ) menu for the host, optionally select View host events . The events in the list are presented chronologically.
4.  For multi-host clusters, in the Role column next to the host name, you can click on the menu to change the role of the host.
3. If you do not select a role, the Assisted Installer will assign the role automatically. The minimum hardware requirements for control plane nodes exceed that of worker nodes. If you assign a role to a host, ensure that you assign the control plane role to hosts that meet the minimum

hardware requirements.

5.  Click the Status link to view hardware, network and operator validations for the host.
6.  Click the arrow to the left of a host name to expand the host details.

Once all cluster hosts appear with a status of Ready , proceed to the next step.

## 4.7. CONFIGURING STORAGE DISKS

Each of the hosts retrieved during host discovery can have multiple storage disks. The storage disks are listed for the host on the Storage page of the Assisted Installer wizard.

You can optionally modify the default configurations for each disk.

<!-- image -->

## IMPORTANT

- Starting from OpenShift Container Platform 4.14, you can configure nodes with Intel® Virtual RAID on CPU (VROC) to manage NVMe RAIDs. For details, see Configuring an Intel® Virtual RAID on CPU (VROC) data volume .
- Starting from OpenShift Container Platform 4.15, you can install a cluster on a single or multipath iSCSI boot device using the Assisted Installer.

## 4.7.1. Changing the installation disk

The Assisted Installer randomly assigns an installation disk by default. If there are multiple storage disks for a host, you can select a different disk to be the installation disk. This automatically unassigns the previous disk.

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) supports multipathing over Fibre Channel on the installation disk, allowing stronger resilience to hardware failure to achieve higher host availability. Multipathing is enabled by default in the agent ISO image, with an /etc/multipath.conf configuration. For details, see  Modifying the DM Multipath configuration file.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the Storage page of the wizard.
2.  Expand a host to display the associated storage disks.
3.  Select Installation disk from the Role list.

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

Multipath devices are automatically discovered and listed in the host's inventory. To assign a multipath Fibre Channel disk as the installation disk, choose a disk with Drive type set to Multipath , rather than to FC which indicates a single path.

4.  When all storage disks return to Ready status, proceed to the next step.

## 4.7.2. Disabling disk formatting

The Assisted Installer marks all bootable disks for formatting during the installation process by default, regardless of whether or not they have been defined as the installation disk. Formatting causes data loss.

You can choose to disable the formatting of a specific disk. Perform this with caution, as bootable disks can interfere with the installation process, mainly in terms of boot order.

You cannot disable formatting for the installation disk.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the Storage page of the wizard.
2.  Expand a host to display the associated storage disks.
3.  Clear Format for a disk.
4.  When all storage disks return to Ready status, proceed to the next step.

## 4.8. CONFIGURING NETWORKING

Before installing OpenShift Container Platform, you must configure the cluster network.

## Procedure

1.  In the Networking step, select one of the following network management types if it is not already selected for you:
2. Cluster-Managed Networking: Selecting cluster-managed networking means that the Assisted Installer will configure a standard network topology. This configuration includes an integrated load balancer and virtual routing for managing the API and Ingress VIP addresses. For details, see Network management types.

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

- Currently, cluster-managed networking is not supported on IBM Z® and IBM Power® in OpenShift Container Platform version 4.13 and later.
- Cluster-managed networking is not supported on single-node OpenShift.
- User-Managed Networking : Selecting user-managed networking deploys OpenShift Container Platform with a non-standard network topology. Select user-managed networking if you want to deploy with an external load balancer and DNS, or if you intend to deploy the cluster nodes across many distinct subnets. For details, see Network management types.

NOTE

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is available for OpenShift Container Platform 4.14 with a user-managed networking configuration only.

<!-- image -->

## IMPORTANT

The Assisted Installer supports a third network management type called ClusterManaged Networking with a User-Managed Load Balancer . This network management type provides automated cluster networking with an external load balancer. Currently you can configure this feature through the API only. For details, see Installing cluster-managed networking with a user-managed load balancer.

2.  For cluster-managed networking, configure the following settings:
- a.  Select your Networking stack type :
3. IPv4 : Select this type when your hosts are only using IPv4.
4. Dual-stack : You can select dual-stack when your hosts are using IPv4 together with IPv6.
- b.  Define the Machine network . You can use the default network or select a subnet.

<!-- image -->

## IMPORTANT

For iSCSI boot volumes, the hosts connect over two machine networks: one designated for the OpenShift Container Platform installation and the other for iSCSI traffic. Ensure you select the OpenShift Container Platform network from the dropdown list. The iSCSI host IP address should not be on the machine network. Choosing the iSCSI network will result in an Insufficient status for the host in the Networking step.

- c.  Define an API virtual IP . An API virtual IP provides an endpoint for all users to interact with, and configure the platform.
- d.  Define an Ingress virtual IP . An Ingress virtual IP provides an endpoint for application traffic flowing from outside the cluster.
3.  Optional: Select Use advanced networking to configure the following advanced networking properties:
4. Cluster network CIDR : Define an IP address block to assign pod IP addresses.
5. Cluster network host prefix : Define a subnet prefix length to assign to each node.
6. Service network CIDR : Define an IP address block to assign service IP addresses.
4.  Optional: Select Host SSH Public Key for troubleshooting after installation to connect to hosts using a public SSH key for troubleshooting after installation.

## 4.9. ADDING MANIFESTS AND PATCHES

You can upload custom manifests and patches for system manifests in the Assisted Installer web console. You can also replace and remove these files.

For information about adding and modifying custom manifests by using the Assisted Installer API, see Adding custom manifests with the API.

## 4.9.1. Preparing custom manifests and manifest patches

This section provides an overview of custom manifests and system manifest patches, including formatting considerations and the required naming conventions for uploading the files.

Follow these guidelines to ensure that the files you upload comply with the system requirements.

## 4.9.1.1. Custom manifests

A custom manifest is a JSON or YAML file that contains advanced configurations not currently supported in the Assisted Installer user interface. You can create a custom manifest or use one provided by a third party.

You can upload a custom manifest from your file system to either the openshift folder or the manifests folder. The number of custom manifest files permitted is unlimited.

You can upload only one file at a time. However, each uploaded YAML file can contain multiple custom manifests. Uploading a multi-document YAML manifest is faster than adding the YAML files individually.

For a file containing a single custom manifest, accepted file extensions include .yaml , .yml , or .json . For a file containing multiple custom manifests, accepted file types include .yaml or .yml .

## Single custom manifest example

apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1 kind: MachineConfig metadata: labels: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: master name: 99-openshift-machineconfig-master-kargs spec: kernelArguments: - loglevel=7

## Multiple custom manifest example

apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1 kind: MachineConfig metadata: labels: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: master name: 99-openshift-machineconfig-master-kargs spec: kernelArguments: - loglevel=7 ---apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v2

```
kind: MachineConfig metadata: labels: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker name: 98-openshift-machineconfig-worker-kargs spec: kernelArguments: - loglevel=5
```

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

When you install OpenShift Container Platform on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) external platform, you must add the custom manifests provided by Oracle. For additional external partner integrations such as vSphere or Nutanix, this step is optional.

## Additional resources

- Working with multi-document YAML files
- Manifest configuration files

## 4.9.1.2. Patches for system manifests

A manifest patch file conforms to the syntax of a YAML patch. Its purpose is to modify a system manifest that is automatically created by the Assisted Installer during installation preparation. Manifest patches are used to adjust onfigurations, manage updates, or apply changes in a structured and automated way. This approach ensures consistency and helps avoid errors when altering complex YAML documents.

## 4.9.1.2.1. General YAML syntax for system manifest patches

The yaml-patch package is an implementation of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Patch , directly transposed to YAML. The general syntax of a system manifest YAML patch is the following:

- op: &lt;add | remove | replace | move | copy | test&gt;

1

from: &lt;source-path&gt;

path: &lt;target-path&gt;

<!-- image -->

value: &lt;any-yaml-structure&gt;

4

- 1 See the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Patch  for an explanation of each operation.
- 2 Only valid for move and copy operations.
- 3 Always mandatory.
- 4 Only valid for add , replace and test operations.

## 4.9.1.2.2. Naming conventions for system manifest patches

When creating a new patch for a system manifest, use the following naming convention: &lt;file to be patched&gt;.patch\_&lt;suffix&gt; . The name itself ensures that the correct manifest is overwritten, and the suffix allows for the application of many patches to the same manifest.

50-masters-chrony-configuration.yaml

For example, if the original file has the name

, then the new

For example, if the original file has the name 50-masters-chrony-configuration.yaml , then the new patch should be called 50-masters-chrony-configuration.yaml.patch\_1\_apply-chrony-dhcp or similar.

The following example outlines the steps for patching a system manifest, and shows how the naming convention is applied:

1.  The Assisted Installer automatically adds the following YAML file to the manifests of the cluster at the start of the installation.

Directory: OpenShift

Filename: 50-masters-chrony-configuration.yaml

```
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1 kind: MachineConfig metadata: labels: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker name: 50-masters-chrony-configuration spec: config: ignition: version: 3.1.0 storage: files: - contents: source: data:text/plain;charset=utf-

2.  To patch this YAML file with different content, you must generate a new base64 representation of the content and create a patch file:
- a.  Generate base64 file content for /etc/chrony.conf :

```
$ cat << EOF | base64 --wrap 0of driftfile /var/lib/chrony/drift makestep 1.0 3 rtcsync logdir /var/log/chrony sourcedir /run/chrony-dhcp
```

EOF

- b.  Create a patch file using this base64 string:

Directory: OpenShift

Filename: 50-masters-chrony-configuration.yaml.patch\_1\_apply-chrony-dhcp

---

- op: replace path: /spec/config/storage/files/0/contents value: data:text/plain;charset=utf8;base64,ZHJpZnRmaWxlIC92YXIvbGliL2Nocm9ueS9kcmlmdAptYWtlc3RlcCAxLjAgMwpy dGNzeW5jCmxvZ2RpciAvdmFyL2xvZy9jaHJvbnkKc291cmNlZGlyIC9ydW4vY2hyb255LWR oY3AK

3.  You then upload the patch file in the Assisted Installer web console. For details, see the following section.

## 4.9.2. Uploading custom manifests and manifest patches

When uploading a custom manifest or patch, enter the filename and select a destination folder. The filename must be unique across both folders; you cannot use the same file name in both folders.

## Prerequisites

- You have saved a custom manifest file to a local directory using an appropriate file name and extension.

## Procedure

1.  On the Cluster details page of the wizard, select the Include custom manifests checkbox.
2.  On the Custom manifest page, in the folder field, select the Assisted Installer folder where you want to save the manifest or patch.

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

You can upload a file to either the openShift or manifest folder. For a manifest patch, the system will look in both folders for the target file that it needs to patch.

3.  In the Filename field, enter a name for the manifest file, including the extension:
2. For custom manifests, examples include manifest1.json or multiple1.yaml .
3. For manifest patches, an example is 50-masters-chronyconfiguration.yaml.patch\_1\_apply-chrony-dhcp .
4.  Under Content , click the Upload icon or Browse button to upload a file. Alternatively, drag the file into the Content field from your file system.
5.  To upload another file, click Add another manifest and repeat the process. This saves any previously uploaded files.

6.  Click Next to save all files and proceed to the Review and create page. Custom manifests displays a list of the uploaded custom manifests and patches.

## 4.9.3. Modifying custom manifests and manifest patches

You can rename uploaded custom manifest or patch files, and save custom manifest files to a different folder. Additionally, you can copy the contents of an existing file, or download it to the folder specified in your Chrome download settings.

It is not possible to edit the content of an uploaded manifest or patch file. Instead, you can overwrite the existing file.

## Prerequisites

- You have uploaded at least one custom manifest or patch file.

## Procedure

1.  To change the location of a custom manifest file, select a different folder from the Folder list.
2.  To change the file name, type the new name for the manifest or patch in the File name field. Patch files should respect the patch naming conventions discussed earlier in this section.
3.  To overwrite a manifest or patch file, save a new file with the same file name in either the openshift or manifest folder.

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

The system will automatically detect and replace the original file, regardless of which folder it is in.

4.  To download a manifest or patch to your file system, click the Download icon.
5.  To copy a manifest or patch, click the Copy to clipboard icon.
6.  To apply the changes, click either Add another manifest or Next .

## 4.9.4. Removing custom manifests and manifest patches

You can remove uploaded custom manifests or patches before installation in one of two ways:

- Removing a single custom manifest or patch.
- Removing all manifests and patches at the same time.

<!-- image -->



## WARNING

Once you have removed a manifest or patch file you cannot undo the action. The workaround is to upload the file again.

## 4.9.4.1. Removing all custom manifests and patches

You can remove all custom manifests and patches at the same time. This also hides the Custom manifest page.

## Prerequisites

- You have uploaded at least one custom manifest or patch file.

## Procedure

1.  Browse to the Cluster details page of the wizard.
2.  Clear the Include custom manifests checkbox.
3.  In the Remove custom manifests dialog box, click Remove .

## 4.9.4.2. Removing a single custom manifest or patch

## 4.10. PREINSTALLATION VALIDATIONS

The Assisted Installer ensures the cluster meets the prerequisites before installation, because it eliminates complex postinstallation troubleshooting, thereby saving significant amounts of time and effort. Before installing the cluster, ensure the cluster and each host pass preinstallation validation.

## Additional resources

- Preinstallation validation

## 4.11. INSTALLING THE CLUSTER

After you have completed the configuration and all the nodes are Ready , you can begin installation. The installation process takes a considerable amount of time, and you can monitor the installation from the

Assisted Installer web console. Nodes will reboot during the installation, and they will initialize after installation.

## Procedure

1.  Click Begin installation .
2.  Click the link in the Status column of the Host Inventory list to see the installation status of a particular host.

## 4.12. COMPLETING THE INSTALLATION

After the cluster is installed and initialized, the Assisted Installer indicates that the installation is finished. The Assisted Installer provides the console URL, the kubeadmin username and password, and the kubeconfig file. Additionally, the Assisted Installer provides cluster details including the OpenShift Container Platform version, base domain, CPU architecture, API and Ingress IP addresses, and the cluster and service network IP addresses.

## Prerequisites

- You have installed the oc CLI tool.

## Procedure

1.  Make a copy of the kubeadmin username and password.
2.  Download the kubeconfig file and copy it to the auth directory under your working directory:

<!-- image -->

$ mkdir -p &lt;working\_directory&gt;/auth

## CHAPTER 5. INSTALLING WITH THE ASSISTED INSTALLER API

After you ensure the cluster nodes and network requirements are met, you can begin installing the cluster by using the Assisted Installer API. To use the API, you must perform the following procedures:

- Set up the API authentication.
- Configure the pull secret.
- Register a new cluster definition.
- Create an infrastructure environment for the cluster.

Once you perform these steps, you can modify the cluster definition, create discovery ISOs, add hosts to the cluster, and install the cluster. This document does not cover every endpoint of the Assisted Installer API, but you can review all of the endpoints in the  API viewer or the swagger.yaml file.

## 5.1. GENERATING THE OFFLINE TOKEN

Download the offline token from the Assisted Installer web console. You will use the offline token to set the API token.

## Prerequisites

- Install jq .
- Log in to the OpenShift Cluster Manager as a user with cluster creation privileges.

## Procedure

1.  In the menu, click Downloads .
2.  In the Tokens section under OpenShift Cluster Manager API Token , click View API Token .
3.  Click Load Token .

<!-- image -->

## IMPORTANT

Disable pop-up blockers.

4.  In the Your API token section, copy the offline token.
5.  In your terminal, set the offline token to the OFFLINE\_TOKEN variable:

<!-- image -->

$ export OFFLINE\_TOKEN=&lt;copied\_token&gt;

## TIP

To make the offline token permanent, add it to your profile.

6.  (Optional) Confirm the OFFLINE\_TOKEN variable definition.

$ echo ${OFFLINE\_TOKEN}

## 5.2. AUTHENTICATING WITH THE REST API

API calls require authentication with the API token. Assuming you use API\_TOKEN as a variable name, add -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API\_TOKEN}" to API calls to authenticate with the REST API.

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

The API token expires after 15 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- You have generated the OFFLINE\_TOKEN variable.

## Procedure

1.  On the command line terminal, set the API\_TOKEN variable using the OFFLINE\_TOKEN to validate the user.
2.  Confirm the API\_TOKEN variable definition:

```
$ export API_TOKEN=$( \ curl \ --silent \ --header "Accept: application/json" \ --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \ --data-urlencode "grant_type=refresh_token" \ --data-urlencode "client_id=cloud-services" \ --data-urlencode "refresh_token=${OFFLINE_TOKEN}" \ "https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token" \ | jq --raw-output ".access_token" \ )
```

$ echo ${API\_TOKEN}

3.  Create a script in your path for one of the token generating methods. For example:

$ vim ~/.local/bin/refresh-token

```
export API_TOKEN=$( \ curl \ --silent \ --header "Accept: application/json" \ --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \ --data-urlencode "grant_type=refresh_token" \ --data-urlencode "client_id=cloud-services" \ --data-urlencode "refresh_token=${OFFLINE_TOKEN}" \ "https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token" \ | jq --raw-output ".access_token" \ )
```

Then, save the file.

4.  Change the file mode to make it executable:

$ chmod +x ~/.local/bin/refresh-token

5.  Refresh the API token:
2. $ source refresh-token
6.  Verify that you can access the API by running the following command:

$ curl -s https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/component-versions -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API\_TOKEN}" | jq

## Example output

```
{ "release_tag": "v2.11.3", "versions": { "assisted-installer": "registry.redhat.io/rhai-tech-preview/assisted-installer-rhel8:v1.0.0211", "assisted-installer-controller": "registry.redhat.io/rhai-tech-preview/assisted-installerreporter-rhel8:v1.0.0-266", "assisted-installer-service": "quay.io/app-sre/assisted-service:78d113a", "discovery-agent": "registry.redhat.io/rhai-tech-preview/assisted-installer-agentrhel8:v1.0.0-195" } }
```

## 5.3. CONFIGURING THE PULL SECRET

Many of the Assisted Installer API calls require the pull secret. Download the pull secret to a file so that you can reference it in API calls. The pull secret is a JSON object that will be included as a value within the request's JSON object. The pull secret JSON must be formatted to escape the quotes. For example:

## Before

<!-- image -->

{"auths":{"cloud.openshift.com": ...

## After

<!-- image -->

{\"auths\":{\"cloud.openshift.com\": ...

## Procedure

1.  In the menu, click OpenShift .
2.  In the submenu, click Downloads .
3.  In the Tokens section under Pull secret , click Download .

4.  To use the pull secret from a shell variable, execute the following command:

$ export PULL\_SECRET=$(cat ~/Downloads/pull-secret.txt | jq -R .)

5.  To slurp the pull secret file using jq , reference it in the pull\_secret variable, piping the value to tojson to ensure that it is properly formatted as escaped JSON. For example:
2. 1 Slurp the pull secret file.
3. 2 Format the pull secret to escaped JSON format.
6.  Confirm the PULL\_SECRET variable definition:

```
$ curl https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/clusters \ -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d "$(jq --null-input \ --slurpfile pull_secret ~/Downloads/pull-secret.txt ' 1 { "name": "testcluster", "control_plane_count": "3", "openshift_version": "4.11", "pull_secret": $pull_secret[0] | tojson, 2 "base_dns_domain": "example.com" } ')"
```

```
$ echo ${PULL_SECRET}
```

## 5.4. GENERATING THE SSH PUBLIC KEY

During the installation of OpenShift Container Platform, you can optionally provide an SSH public key to the installation program. This is useful for initiating an SSH connection to a remote node when troubeshooting an installation error.

If you do not have an existing SSH key pair on your local machine to use for the authentication, create one now.

## Prerequisites

- Generate the OFFLINE\_TOKEN and API\_TOKEN variables.

## Procedure

1.  From the root user in your terminal, get the SSH public key:

$ cat /root/.ssh/id\_rsa.pub

2.  Set the SSH public key to the CLUSTER\_SSHKEY variable:

$ CLUSTER\_SSHKEY=&lt;downloaded\_ssh\_key&gt;

3.  Confirm the CLUSTER\_SSHKEY variable definition:

$ echo ${CLUSTER\_SSHKEY}

## 5.5. REGISTERING A NEW CLUSTER

To register a new cluster definition with the API, use the /v2/clusters endpoint.

The following parameters are mandatory:

- name
- openshift-version
- pull\_secret
- cpu\_architecture

See the cluster-create-params model in the  API viewer for details on the fields you can set when registering a new cluster. When setting the olm\_operators field, see Additional Resources for details on installing Operators.

## Prerequisites

- You have generated a valid API\_TOKEN . Tokens expire every 15 minutes.
- You have downloaded the pull secret.
- Optional: You have assigned the pull secret to the $PULL\_SECRET variable.

## Procedure

1.  Refresh the API token:

$ source refresh-token

2.  Register a new cluster by using one of the following methods:
2. Register the cluster by referencing the pull secret file in the request:

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

```
$ curl -s -X POST https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/clusters \ -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d "$(jq --null-input \ --slurpfile pull_secret ~/Downloads/pull-secret.txt ' \ { \ "name": "testcluster", \ "openshift_version": "4.16", \ 1 "control_plane_count": "<number>", \ 2 "cpu_architecture" : "<architecture_name>", \ 3 "base_dns_domain": "example.com", \ "pull_secret": $pull_secret[0] | tojson \ } \ ')" | jq '.id'
```

- Register the cluster by doing the following:
- i.  Writing the configuration to a JSON file:
- ii.  Referencing it in the request:
- 1 1 Pay attention to the following:
- To install the latest OpenShift version, use the x.y format, such as 4.16 for version 4.16.10. To install a specific OpenShift version, use the x.y.z format, such as 4.16.3 for version 4.16.3.
- To install a multi-architecture compute cluster, add the -multi extension, such as 4.16-multi for the latest version or 4.16.3-multi for a specific version.
- If you are booting from an iSCSI drive, enter OpenShift Container Platform version 4.15 or later.

## 5.5.1. Installing Operators

You can customize your deployment by adding Operators to the cluster during installation. You can install one or more Operators individually or add a group of Operators that form a bundle. If you require advanced options, add the Operators after you have installed the cluster.

This step is optional.

## 5.5.1.1. Installing standalone Operators

Before selecting Operators for installation, you can verify which Operators are available in the Assisted Installer. You can also check whether an Operator is supported for a specific OCP version, CPU architecture, or platform.

You set the required Operator definitions by using the POST method for the assisted-

You set the required Operator definitions by using the POST method for the assistedservice/v2/clusters/{cluster\_id} endpoint and by setting the olm\_operators parameter.

The Assisted Installer allows you to install the following standalone Operators. For additional Operators that you can select as part of a bundle, see Installing bundle Operators.

- OpenShift Virtualization Operator ( cnv )

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

- Currently, OpenShift Virtualization is not supported on IBM Z® and IBM Power®.
- The OpenShift Virtualization Operator requires backend storage and might automatically activate a storage Operator in the background, according to the following criteria:
- None - If the CPU architecture is ARM64, no storage Operator is activated.
- LVM Storage - For single-node OpenShift clusters on any other CPU architecture deploying OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 or higher.
- Local Storage Operator (LSO) - For all other deployments.
- Migration Toolkit for Virtualization Operator ( mtv )

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

Specifying the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization (MTV) Operator automatically activates the OpenShift Virtualization Operator. For a Single-node OpenShift installation, the Assisted Installer also activates the LVM Storage Operator.

- Multicluster engine Operator ( mce )

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

Deploying the multicluster engine without OpenShift Data Foundation results in the following storage configurations:

- Multi-node cluster: No storage is configured. You must configure storage after the installation.
- Single-node OpenShift: LVM Storage is installed.
- OpenShift Data Foundation Operator ( odf )
- Logical Volume Manager Storage Operator ( lvm )
- OpenShift AI Operator ( openshift-ai )
- OpenShift sandboxed containers Operator ( osc )

## 5.5.2. Scheduling workloads to run on control plane nodes

Use the schedulable\_masters attribute to enable workloads to run on control plane nodes.

## Prerequisites

- You have generated a valid API\_TOKEN . Tokens expire every 15 minutes.
- You have created a $PULL\_SECRET variable.
- You are installing OpenShift Container Platform 4.14 or later.

## Procedure

1.  Follow the instructions for installing Assisted Installer using the Assisted Installer API.
2.  When you reach the step for registering a new cluster, set the schedulable\_masters attribute as follows:

```
$ curl https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/clusters/${CLUSTER_ID} \ -X PATCH \ -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d '
```

```
{ "schedulable_masters": true 1 } ' | jq
```

- 1 Enables the scheduling of workloads on the control plane nodes.

## 5.5.3. Configuring the network management type

The Assisted Installer lets you install the following network management types:

- Cluster-managed networking
- User-managed networking
- Cluster managed networking with a user-managed load balancer

You define the network management type by adding the user\_managed\_networking and load\_balancer attributes to the cluster definition, as in the example below:

```
$ curl -s -X POST https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/clusters \ -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d "$(jq --null-input \ --slurpfile pull_secret ~/Downloads/pull-secret.txt ' { "name": "testcluster", "openshift_version": "4.18", "cpu_architecture" : "x86_64", "base_dns_domain": "example.com", "user_managed_networking": "false", "load_balancer": { "type": "cluster-managed" } "pull_secret": $pull_secret[0] | tojson } ')" | jq '.id'
```

Where:

- user\_managed\_networking is either true or false .
- load\_balancer can have the type user-managed or cluster-managed .

You can review the user\_managed\_networking and load\_balancer valid values in the  swagger.yaml file.

This step is optional. If you do not define a network management type, the Assisted Installer applies cluster-managed networking by default to all highly available clusters. For single-node OpenShift, the Assisted Installer applies user-managed networking by default.

## 5.5.3.1. Installing cluster-managed networking

Selecting cluster-managed networking means that the Assisted Installer will configure a standard

Selecting cluster-managed networking means that the Assisted Installer will configure a standard network topology. This configuration includes an integrated load balancer and virtual routing for managing the API and Ingress VIP addresses. For details, see Network management types.

## Prerequisites

- You are installing an OpenShift Container Platform cluster of three or more control plane nodes.

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

Currently, cluster-managed networking is not supported on IBM Z® and IBM Power® in OpenShift Container Platform version 4.13 and later.

## Procedure

- To define cluster-managed networking, add the following attributes and values to your cluster definition:

<!-- image -->

```
"user_managed_networking": false, "load_balancer": { "type": "cluster-managed" }
```

Where the load\_balancer attribute is optional. If omitted for this configuration, the type is automatically set to user-managed for single-node OpenShift or to cluster-managed for all other implementations.

## Additional resources

- Configuring networking by using the web console

## 5.5.3.2. Installing user-managed networking

Selecting user-managed networking deploys OpenShift Container Platform with a non-standard network topology. Select user-managed networking if you want to deploy a cluster with an external load balancer and DNS, or if you intend to deploy the cluster nodes across many distinct subnets.

For details, see Network management types.

The Assisted Installer lets you deploy more than one external load balancer for user-managed networking.

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is available for OpenShift Container Platform 4.14 with a user-managed networking configuration only.

## Procedure

- To define user-managed networking, add the following attributes to your cluster definition:

<!-- image -->

"user\_managed\_networking": true,

NOTE

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

The load\_balancer attribute is not required when user-managed networking is set to true , because you will be provisioning your own load balancer.

## Network Validations

When you enable user-managed networking, the following network validations change:

- The L3 connectivity check (ICMP) replaces the L2 check (ARP).
- The maximum transmission unit (MTU) validation verifies the MTU value for all interfaces and not only for the machine network.

## Additional resources

- Configuring networking by using the web console .

## 5.5.3.3. Installing cluster-managed networking with a user-managed load balancer

Cluster-managed networking with a user-managed load balancer is a hybrid network management type designed for scenarios that require automated cluster networking with external control over load balancing. This approach enables users to provide one or more external load balancers (for example, an API load balancer and an Ingress load balancer), while retaining the bare-metal features installed in cluster-managed networking.

For details, see Network management types.

<!-- image -->

## IMPORTANT

Cluster-managed networking with a user-managed load balancer is a Developer Preview feature only. Developer Preview features are not supported by Red Hat in any way and are not functionally complete or production-ready. Do not use Developer Preview features for production or business-critical workloads. Developer Preview features provide early access to upcoming product features in advance of their possible inclusion in a Red Hat product offering, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process. These features might not have any documentation, are subject to change or removal at any time, and testing is limited. Red Hat might provide ways to submit feedback on Developer Preview features without an associated SLA.

## 5.5.3.3.1. Installing cluster-managed networking with a user-managed load balancer on a baremetal platform

Use the Assisted Installer API to deploy the "cluster-managed networking with a user-managed load balancer" network management type on a bare-metal platform.

## Prerequisites

- You are installing OpenShift Container Platform version 4.16 or higher.
- The installation is on a bare-metal platform.
- You are using IPv4 single-stack networking.

- You are installing an OpenShift Container Platform cluster of three or more control plane nodes.

## Procedure

1.  In OpenShift Container Platform, configure the load balancer to be accessible from all hosts and have access to the following services:
2. OpenShift Machine Config Operator (MCO) - On control plane nodes.
3. OpenShift API - On control plane nodes.
4. Ingress Controller - On compute (worker) nodes.

For details, see Services for a user-managed load balancer .

2.  In the Assisted Installer, add the following fields to the API cluster definitions:
- a.  Configure cluster-managed networking and a user-managed load balancer by setting the user\_managed\_networking and load\_balancer fields to the following values:

```
"user_managed_networking": false, "load_balancer": { "type": "user-managed" }
```

For details, see Changing the network management type.

- b.  Specify the Ingress and API VIPs in the cluster definitions. These should correspond to the load balancer IP address:
- c.  Specify a list of machine networks to ensure the following:
3. Each node has at least one network interface card (NIC) with an IP address in at least one machine network.
4. The load balancer IP, which is also the API VIP and Ingress VIP, is included in at least one of the machine networks. The following is an example:

```
"ingress_vips": [ { "cluster_id": "<cluster-id>", "ip": "<load-balancer-ip>" } ], "api_vips": [ { "cluster_id": "<cluster-id>", "ip": "<load-balancer-ip>" } ]
```

```
"machine_networks": [ { "cidr": "<hosts-cidr-1>", "cluster_id": "<cluster-id>"
```

```
}, { "cidr": "<hosts-cidr-2>", "cluster_id": "<cluster-id>" }, { "cidr": "<load-balancer-cidr>", "cluster_id": "<cluster-id>" } ]
```

For more details, see Machine network.

## Network Validations

When you enable this network management type, the following network validations change:

- The L3 connectivity check (ICMP) replaces the L2 check (ARP).
- The maximum transmission unit (MTU) validation verifies the MTU value for all interfaces and not only for the machine network.

## 5.6. MODIFYING A CLUSTER

To modify a cluster definition with the API, use the /v2/clusters/{cluster\_id} endpoint. Modifying a cluster resource is a common operation for adding settings such as changing the network type or enabling user-managed networking. See the v2-cluster-update-params model in the  API viewer for details on the fields you can set when modifying a cluster definition.

You can add or remove Operators from a cluster resource that has already been registered.

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

To create partitions on nodes, see Configuring storage on nodes in the OpenShift Container Platform documentation.

## Prerequisites

- You have created a new cluster resource.

## Procedure

1.  Refresh the API token:

$ source refresh-token

2.  Modify the cluster. For example, change the SSH key:

```
$ curl https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/clusters/${CLUSTER_ID} \ -X PATCH \ -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d ' { "ssh_public_key": "ssh-rsa

## 5.6.1. Modifying Operators by using the API

You can add or remove Operators from a cluster resource that has already been registered as part of a previous installation. This is only possible before you start the OpenShift Container Platform installation.

You modify the required Operator definition by using the PATCH method for the assistedservice/v2/clusters/{cluster\_id} endpoint and by setting the olm\_operators parameter.

## Prerequisites

- You have refreshed the API token.
- You have exported the CLUSTER\_ID as an environment variable.

## Procedure

- Run the following command to modify the Operators:
- 1 Specify cnv for OpenShift Virtualization, mtv for Migration Toolkit for Virtualization, mce for multicluster engine, odf for Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation, lvm for Logical Volume Manager Storage, openshift-ai for OpenShift AI, osc for OpenShift sandboxed containers, nmstate for Kubernetes NMState, amd-gpu for AMD GPU, kmm for Kernel Module Management, node-feature-discovery for Node Feature Discovery, nvidia-gpu for NVIDIA GPU, self-node-remediation for Self Node Remediation, pipelines for OpenShift Pipelines, servicemesh for OpenShift Service Mesh, node-healthcheck for Node Health Check, lso for Local Storage Operator, fence-agents-remediation for Fence Agents Remediation, kube-descheduler for Kube Descheduler, serverless for OpenShift Serverless, and authorino for Authorino.
- 2 To modify the Operators, add a new complete list of Operators that you want to install, and not just the differences. To remove all previously installed Operators, specify an empty array: "olm\_operators": [] .

<!-- image -->

```
$ curl https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/clusters/${CLUSTER_ID} \ -X PATCH \ -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d ' { "olm_operators": [{"name": "mce"}, {"name": "cnv"}], 1 2 } ' | jq '.id'
```

## Example output

```
{ <various cluster properties>, "monitored_operators": [ { "cluster_id": "b5259f97-be09-430e-b5eb-d78420ee509a", "name": "console", "operator_type": "builtin", "status_updated_at": "0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "timeout_seconds": 3600 }, { "cluster_id": "b5259f97-be09-430e-b5eb-d78420ee509a", "name": "cvo", "operator_type": "builtin", "status_updated_at": "0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "timeout_seconds": 3600 }, { "cluster_id": "b5259f97-be09-430e-b5eb-d78420ee509a", "name": "mce", "namespace": "multicluster-engine", "operator_type": "olm", "status_updated_at": "0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "subscription_name": "multicluster-engine", "timeout_seconds": 3600 }, { "cluster_id": "b5259f97-be09-430e-b5eb-d78420ee509a", "name": "cnv", "namespace": "openshift-cnv", "operator_type": "olm", "status_updated_at": "0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "subscription_name": "hco-operatorhub", "timeout_seconds": 3600 }, { "cluster_id": "b5259f97-be09-430e-b5eb-d78420ee509a", "name": "lvm", "namespace": "openshift-local-storage", "operator_type": "olm", "status_updated_at": "0001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "subscription_name": "local-storage-operator", "timeout_seconds": 4200 } ], <more cluster properties>
```

NOTE

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

The output is the description of the new cluster state. The monitored\_operators property in the output contains Operators of two types:

- "operator\_type": "builtin" : Operators of this type are an integral part of OpenShift Container Platform.
- "operator\_type": "olm" : Operators of this type are added manually by a user or automatically, as a dependency. In this example, the LVM Storage Operator is added automatically as a dependency of OpenShift Virtualization.

## Additional resources

- See Customizing your installation using Operators and Operator Bundles for an overview of each Operator that you intend to install, together with its prerequisites and dependencies.

## 5.7. REGISTERING A NEW INFRASTRUCTURE ENVIRONMENT

Once you register a new cluster definition with the Assisted Installer API, create an infrastructure environment using the v2/infra-envs endpoint. Registering a new infrastructure environment requires the following settings:

- name
- pull\_secret
- cpu\_architecture

See the infra-env-create-params model in the  API viewer for details on the fields you can set when registering a new infrastructure environment. You can modify an infrastructure environment after you create it. As a best practice, consider including the cluster\_id when creating a new infrastructure environment. The cluster\_id will associate the infrastructure environment with a cluster definition. When creating the new infrastructure environment, the Assisted Installer will also generate a discovery ISO.

## Prerequisites

- You have generated a valid API\_TOKEN . Tokens expire every 15 minutes.
- You have downloaded the pull secret.
- Optional: You have registered a new cluster definition and exported the cluster\_id .

## Procedure

1.  Refresh the API token:
2. $ source refresh-token
2.  Register a new infrastructure environment. Provide a name, preferably something including the cluster name. This example provides the cluster ID to associate the infrastructure environment with the cluster resource. The following example specifies the image\_type . You can specify either full-iso or minimal-iso . The default value is minimal-iso .

<!-- image -->

- a.  Optional: You can register a new infrastructure environment by slurping the pull secret file in the request:
2. $ curl https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/infra-envs \ -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API\_TOKEN}" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d "$(jq --null-input \ --slurpfile pull\_secret ~/Downloads/pull-secret.txt \ --arg cluster\_id ${CLUSTER\_ID} ' { "name": "testcluster-infra-env", "image\_type":"full-iso", "cluster\_id": $cluster\_id, "cpu\_architecture" : "&lt;architecture\_name&gt;", 1 "pull\_secret": $pull\_secret[0] | tojson } ')" | jq '.id'

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

<!-- image -->

Valid values are x86\_64 , arm64 , ppc64le , s390x , and multi .

- b.  Optional: You can register a new infrastructure environment by writing the configuration to a JSON file and then referencing it in the request:
3.  Assign the returned id to the INFRA\_ENV\_ID variable and export it:

```
$ cat << EOF > infra-envs.json { "name": "testcluster", "pull_secret": $PULL_SECRET, "proxy": { "http_proxy": "", "https_proxy": "", "no_proxy": "" }, "ssh_authorized_key": "$CLUSTER_SSHKEY", "image_type": "full-iso", "cluster_id": "${CLUSTER_ID}", "openshift_version": "4.11" } EOF
```

```
$ curl -s -X POST "https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/infra-envs" -d @./infra-envs.json -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" | jq '.id'
```

<!-- image -->

$ export INFRA\_ENV\_ID=&lt;id&gt;

NOTE

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

Once you create an infrastructure environment and associate it to a cluster definition via the cluster\_id , you can see the cluster settings in the Assisted Installer web user interface. If you close your terminal session, you need to re-export the id in a new terminal session.

## 5.8. MODIFYING AN INFRASTRUCTURE ENVIRONMENT

You can modify an infrastructure environment using the /v2/infra-envs/{infra\_env\_id} endpoint. Modifying an infrastructure environment is a common operation for adding settings such as networking, SSH keys, or ignition configuration overrides.

See the infra-env-update-params model in the  API viewer for details on the fields you can set when modifying an infrastructure environment. When modifying the new infrastructure environment, the Assisted Installer will also re-generate the discovery ISO.

## Prerequisites

- You have created a new infrastructure environment.

## Procedure

1.  Refresh the API token:
2. $ source refresh-token
2.  Modify the infrastructure environment:

$ curl https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/infra-envs/${INFRA\_ENV\_ID} \

- -X PATCH \ -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API\_TOKEN}" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d "$(jq --null-input \ --slurpfile pull\_secret ~/Downloads/pull-secret.txt ' { "image\_type":"minimal-iso", "pull\_secret": $pull\_secret[0] | tojson } ')" | jq

## 5.8.1. Adding kernel arguments

Providing kernel arguments to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) kernel via the Assisted Installer means passing specific parameters or options to the kernel at boot time, particularly when you cannot customize the kernel parameters of the discovery ISO. Kernel parameters can control various aspects of the kernel's behavior and the operating system's configuration, affecting hardware interaction, system performance, and functionality. Kernel arguments are used to customize or inform the node's RHCOS kernel about the hardware configuration, debugging preferences, system services, and other low-level settings.

The RHCOS installer kargs modify command supports the append , delete , and replace options.

You can modify an infrastructure environment using the /v2/infra-envs/{infra\_env\_id} endpoint. When

You can modify an infrastructure environment using the /v2/infra-envs/{infra\_env\_id} endpoint. When modifying the new infrastructure environment, the Assisted Installer will also re-generate the discovery ISO.

## Procedure

1.  Refresh the API token:

$ source refresh-token

2.  Modify the kernel arguments:

$ curl https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/infra-envs/${INFRA\_ENV\_ID} \

<!-- image -->

```
-X PATCH \ -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d "$(jq --null-input \ --slurpfile pull_secret ~/Downloads/pull-secret.txt ' { "kernel_arguments": [{ "operation": "append", "value": "<karg>=<value>" }], 1 "image_type":"minimal-iso", "pull_secret": $pull_secret[0] | tojson } ')" | jq
```

<!-- image -->

- Replace &lt;karg&gt; with the the kernel argument and &lt;value&gt; with the kernal argument value. For example: rd.net.timeout.carrier=60 . You can specify multiple kernel arguments by adding a JSON object for each kernel argument.

## 5.9. ADDING HOSTS

After configuring the cluster resource and infrastructure environment, download the discovery ISO image. You can choose from two images:

- Full ISO image: Use the full ISO image when booting must be self-contained. The image includes everything needed to boot and start the Assisted Installer agent. The ISO image is about 1GB in size. This is the recommended method for the s390x architecture when installing with RHEL KVM.
- Minimal ISO image: Use the minimal ISO image when the virtual media connection has limited bandwidth. This is the default setting. The image includes only what the agent requires to boot a host with networking. The majority of the content is downloaded upon boot. The ISO image is about 100MB in size.

This option is mandatory in the following scenarios:

- If you are installing OpenShift Container Platform on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
- If you are installing OpenShift Container Platform on iSCSI boot volumes.

## NOTE

Currently, ISO images are supported on IBM Z® ( s390x ) with KVM, iPXE with z/VM, and LPAR (both static and DPM). For details, see Booting hosts using iPXE .

<!-- image -->

You can boot hosts with the discovery image using three methods. For details, see Booting hosts with the discovery image.

## Prerequisites

- You have created a cluster.
- You have created an infrastructure environment.
- You have completed the configuration.
- If the cluster hosts are behind a firewall that requires the use of a proxy, you have configured the username, password, IP address and port for the HTTP and HTTPS URLs of the proxy server.

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

The proxy username and password must be URL-encoded.

- You have selected an image type or will use the default minimal-iso .

## Procedure

1.  Configure the discovery image if needed. For details, see Configuring the discovery image.
2.  Refresh the API token:

$ source refresh-token

3.  Get the download URL:

$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API\_TOKEN}" \ https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/infraenvs/${INFRA\_ENV\_ID}/downloads/image-url

## Example output

```
{ "expires_at": "2024-02-07T20:20:23.000Z", "url": "https://api.openshift.com/api/assistedimages/bytoken/<TOKEN>/<OCP_VERSION>/<CPU_ARCHITECTURE>/<FULL_OR_MINIM AL_IMAGE>.iso" }
```

4.  Download the discovery image:

$ wget -O discovery.iso &lt;url&gt;

Replace &lt;url&gt; with the download URL from the previous step.

5.  Boot the host(s) with the discovery image.
6.  Assign a role to host(s).

## Additional resources

- Booting hosts with the discovery image
- Adding hosts on Nutanix with the API
- Adding hosts on vSphere
- Assigning roles to hosts
- Booting hosts using iPXE

## 5.10. MODIFYING HOSTS

After adding hosts, modify the hosts as needed. The most common modifications are to the host\_name and the host\_role parameters.

You can modify a host by using the /v2/infra-envs/{infra\_env\_id}/hosts/{host\_id} endpoint. See the host-update-params model in the  API viewer for details on the fields you can set when modifying a host.

A host might be one of two roles:

- master : A host with the master role will operate as a control plane host.
- worker : A host with the worker role will operate as a worker host.

By default, the Assisted Installer sets a host to auto-assign , which means the installation program determines whether the host is a master or worker role automatically. Use the following procedure to set the host's role:

## Prerequisites

- You have added hosts to the cluster.

## Procedure

1.  Refresh the API token:

$ source refresh-token

2.  Get the host IDs:

$ curl -s -X GET "https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/clusters/$CLUSTER\_ID" \ --header "Content-Type: application/json" \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $API\_TOKEN" \ | jq '.host\_networks[].host\_ids'

3.  Modify the host:

$ curl https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/infraenvs/${INFRA\_ENV\_ID}/hosts/&lt;host\_id&gt; \ 1 -X PATCH \

```
-H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d ' { "host_role":"worker" "host_name" : "worker-1" } ' | jq
```

- 1 Replace &lt;host\_id&gt; with the ID of the host.

## 5.10.1. Modifying storage disk configuration

Each host retrieved during host discovery can have multiple storage disks. You can optionally change the default configurations for each disk.

<!-- image -->

## IMPORTANT

- Starting from OpenShift Container Platform 4.14, you can configure nodes with Intel® Virtual RAID on CPU (VROC) to manage NVMe RAIDs. For details, see Configuring an Intel® Virtual RAID on CPU (VROC) data volume .
- Starting from OpenShift Container Platform 4.15, you can install a cluster on a single or multipath iSCSI boot device using the Assisted Installer.

## Prerequisites

- Configure the cluster and discover the hosts. For details, see Additional resources .

## 5.10.1.1. Viewing the storage disks

You can view the hosts in your cluster, and the disks on each host. You can then perform actions on a specific disk.

## Procedure

1.  Refresh the API token:

$ source refresh-token

2.  Get the host IDs for the cluster:

```
$ curl -s "https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/clusters/$CLUSTER_ID" \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \ | jq '.host_networks[].host_ids'
```

## Example output

<!-- image -->

"1022623e-7689-8b2d-7fbd-e6f4d5bb28e5"

NOTE

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

This is the ID of a single host. Multiple host IDs are separated by commas.

3.  Get the disks for a specific host:
2. 1 Replace &lt;host\_id&gt; with the ID of the relevant host.

```
$ curl https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/infraenvs/${INFRA_ENV_ID}/hosts/<host_id> \ 1 -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \ | jq '.inventory | fromjson | .disks'
```

## Example output

```
[ { "by_id": "/dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x6c81f660f98afb002d3adc1a1460a506", "by_path": "/dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:03:00.0-scsi-0:2:0:0", "drive_type": "HDD", "has_uuid": true, "hctl": "1:2:0:0", "id": "/dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x6c81f660f98afb002d3adc1a1460a506", "installation_eligibility": { "eligible": true, "not_eligible_reasons": null }, "model": "PERC_H710P", "name": "sda", "path": "/dev/sda", "serial": "0006a560141adc3a2d00fb8af960f681", "size_bytes": 6595056500736, "vendor": "DELL", "wwn": "0x6c81f660f98afb002d3adc1a1460a506" } ]
```

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

This is the output for one disk. It has the disk\_id and installation\_eligibility properties for the disk.

## 5.10.1.2. Changing the installation disk

The Assisted Installer randomly assigns an installation disk by default. If there are multiple storage disks for a host, you can select a different disk to be the installation disk. This automatically unassigns the previous disk.

You can select any disk whose installation\_eligibility property is eligible: true to be the installation disk.

NOTE

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) supports multipathing over Fibre Channel on the installation disk, allowing stronger resilience to hardware failure to achieve higher host availability. Multipathing is enabled by default in the agent ISO image, with an /etc/multipath.conf configuration. For details, see  Modifying the DM Multipath configuration file.

## Procedure

1.  Get the host and storage disk IDs. For details, see Viewing the storage disks .
2.  Optional: Identify the current installation disk:

<!-- image -->

$ curl https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/infraenvs/${INFRA\_ENV\_ID}/hosts/&lt;host\_id&gt; \ 1 -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API\_TOKEN}" \ | jq '.installation\_disk\_id'

<!-- image -->

Replace &lt;host\_id&gt; with the ID of the relevant host.

3.  Assign a new installation disk:

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

Multipath devices are automatically discovered and listed in the host's inventory. To assign a multipath Fibre Channel disk as the installation disk, choose a disk with "drive\_type" set to "Multipath" , rather than to "FC" which indicates a single path.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

```
$ curl https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/infraenvs/${INFRA_ENV_ID}/hosts/<host_id> \ 1 -X PATCH \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \ { "disks_selected_config": [ { "id": "<disk_id>", 2 "role": "install" } ] }
```

- 1 Replace &lt;host\_id&gt; with the ID of the host.
- 2 Replace &lt;disk\_id&gt; with the ID of the new installation disk.

## 5.10.1.3. Disabling disk formatting

The Assisted Installer marks all bootable disks for formatting during the installation process by default,

The Assisted Installer marks all bootable disks for formatting during the installation process by default, regardless of whether or not they have been defined as the installation disk. Formatting causes data loss.

You can choose to disable the formatting of a specific disk. Disable formatting with caution, as bootable disks can interfere with the installation process, specifically the boot order.

You cannot disable formatting for the installation disk.

## Procedure

1.  Get the host and storage disk IDs. For details, see Viewing the storage disks .
2.  Run the following command:

$ curl https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/infra- envs/${INFRA\_ENV\_ID}/hosts/&lt;host\_id&gt; \

1

-X PATCH \

-H "Content-Type: application/json" \

-H "Authorization: Bearer ${API\_TOKEN}" \

{

"disks\_skip\_formatting": [

{

"disk\_id": "&lt;disk\_id&gt;",

"skip\_formatting": true

<!-- image -->

}

]

}

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

<!-- image -->

Replace &lt;host\_id&gt; with the ID of the host.

&lt;disk\_id&gt;

Replace with the ID of the disk. If there is more than one disk,

<!-- image -->

- 3 To re-enable formatting, change the value to false .

separate the IDs with a comma.

## 5.11. ADDING CUSTOM MANIFESTS

A custom manifest is a JSON or YAML file that contains advanced configurations not currently supported in the Assisted Installer user interface. You can create a custom manifest or use one provided by a third party. To create a custom manifest with the API, use the /v2/clusters/$CLUSTER\_ID/manifests endpoint.

You can upload a base64-encoded custom manifest to either the openshift folder or the manifests folder with the Assisted Installer API. There is no limit to the number of custom manifests permitted.

You can only upload one base64-encoded JSON manifest at a time. However, each uploaded base64encoded YAML file can contain multiple custom manifests. Uploading a multi-document YAML manifest is faster than adding the YAML files individually.

For a file containing a single custom manifest, accepted file extensions include .yaml , .yml , or .json .

## Single custom manifest example

```
{ "apiVersion": "machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1", "kind": "MachineConfig", "metadata": { "labels": { "machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role": "primary" }, "name": "10_primary_storage_config" }, "spec": { "config": { "ignition": { "version": "3.2.0" }, "storage": { "disks": [ { "device": "</dev/xxyN>", "partitions": [ { "label": "recovery", "startMiB": 32768, "sizeMiB": 16384 } ] } ], "filesystems": [ { "device": "/dev/disk/by-partlabel/recovery", "label": "recovery", "format": "xfs" } ] } } } }
```

For a file containing multiple custom manifests, accepted file types include .yaml or .yml .

## Multiple custom manifest example

```
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1 kind: MachineConfig metadata: labels: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: master name: 99-openshift-machineconfig-master-kargs spec: kernelArguments: - loglevel=7 ---apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v2 kind: MachineConfig
```

```
metadata: labels: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker name: 98-openshift-machineconfig-worker-kargs spec: kernelArguments: - loglevel=5
```

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

- When you install OpenShift Container Platform on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) external platform, you must add the custom manifests provided by Oracle. For additional external partner integrations such as vSphere or Nutanix, this step is optional.
- For more information about custom manifests, see Additional Resources .

## Prerequisites

- You have generated a valid API\_TOKEN . Tokens expire every 15 minutes.
- You have registered a new cluster definition and exported the cluster\_id to the $CLUSTER\_ID BASH variable.

## Procedure

1.  Create a custom manifest file.
2.  Save the custom manifest file using the appropriate extension for the file format.
3.  Refresh the API token:

$ source refresh-token

4.  Add the custom manifest to the cluster by executing the following command:

```
$ curl -X POST "https://api.openshift.com/api/assistedinstall/v2/clusters/$CLUSTER_ID/manifests" \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d '{ "file_name":"manifest.json", "folder":"manifests", "content":"'"$(base64 -w 0 ~/manifest.json)"'" }' | jq
```

Replace manifest.json with the name of your manifest file. The second instance of manifest.json is the path to the file. Ensure the path is correct.

## Example output

```
{ "file_name": "manifest.json", "folder": "manifests"
```

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

The base64 -w 0 command base64-encodes the manifest as a string and omits carriage returns. Encoding with carriage returns will generate an exception.

5.  Verify that the Assisted Installer added the manifest:

$ curl -X GET "https://api.openshift.com/api/assistedinstall/v2/clusters/$CLUSTER\_ID/manifests/files?folder=manifests&amp;file\_name=manifest.json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $API\_TOKEN"

Replace manifest.json with the name of your manifest file.

## Additional resources

- Manifest configuration files
- Multi-document YAML files

## 5.12. PREINSTALLATION VALIDATIONS

The Assisted Installer ensures the cluster meets the prerequisites before installation, because it eliminates complex postinstallation troubleshooting, thereby saving significant amounts of time and effort. Before installing the cluster, ensure the cluster and each host pass preinstallation validation.

## Additional resources

- Preinstallation validations

## 5.13. INSTALLING THE CLUSTER

Once the cluster hosts past validation, you can install the cluster.

## Prerequisites

- You have created a cluster and infrastructure environment.
- You have added hosts to the infrastructure environment.
- The hosts have passed validation.

## Procedure

1.  Refresh the API token:

<!-- image -->

$ source refresh-token

2.  Install the cluster:

<!-- image -->

$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API\_TOKEN" \

-X POST \

https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/clusters/$CLUSTER\_ID/actions/install | jq

3.  Complete any postinstallation platform integration steps.

## CHAPTER 6. ENABLING DISK ENCRYPTION

You can enable encryption of installation disks using either the TPM v2 or Tang encryption modes.

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

In some situations, when you enable TPM disk encryption in the firmware for a bare-metal host and then boot it from an ISO that you generate with the Assisted Installer, the cluster deployment can get stuck. This can happen if there are left-over TPM encryption keys from a previous installation on the host. For more information, see BZ#2011634. If you experience this problem, contact Red Hat support.

## 6.1. ENABLING TPM V2 ENCRYPTION

## Prerequisites

- Check to see if TPM v2 encryption is enabled in the BIOS on each host. Most Dell systems require this. Check the manual for your computer. The Assisted Installer will also validate that TPM is enabled in the firmware. See the disk-encruption model in the  Assisted Installer API for additional details.

<!-- image -->

## IMPORTANT

Verify that a TPM v2 encryption chip is installed on each node and enabled in the firmware.

## Procedure

1.  Optional: Using the web console, in the Cluster details step of the user interface wizard, choose to enable TPM v2 encryption on either the control plane nodes, workers, or both.
2.  Optional: Using the API, follow the "Modifying hosts" procedure. Set the disk\_encryption.enable\_on setting to all , masters , or workers . Set the disk\_encryption.mode setting to tpmv2 .
- a.  Refresh the API token:

<!-- image -->

$ source refresh-token

- b.  Enable TPM v2 encryption:

```
$ curl https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/clusters/${CLUSTER_ID} \ -X PATCH \ -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d ' { "disk_encryption": { "enable_on": "none", "mode": "tpmv2" } } ' | jq
```

Valid settings for enable\_on are all , master , worker , or none .

## 6.2. ENABLING TANG ENCRYPTION

## Prerequisites

- You have access to a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8 machine that can be used to generate a thumbprint of the Tang exchange key.

## Procedure

1.  Set up a Tang server or access an existing one. See Network-bound disk encryption for instructions. You can set multiple Tang servers, but the Assisted Installer must be able to connect to all of them during installation.
2.  On the Tang server, retrieve the thumbprint for the Tang server using tang-show-keys :

<!-- image -->

$ tang-show-keys &lt;port&gt;

Optional: Replace &lt;port&gt; with the port number. The default port number is 80 .

## Example thumbprint

<!-- image -->

1gYTN\_LpU9ZMB35yn5IbADY5OQ0

3.  Optional: Retrieve the thumbprint for the Tang server using jose .
- a.  Ensure jose is installed on the Tang server:

<!-- image -->

$ sudo dnf install jose

- b.  On the Tang server, retrieve the thumbprint using jose :

<!-- image -->

$ sudo jose jwk thp -i /var/db/tang/&lt;public\_key&gt;.jwk

Replace &lt;public\_key&gt; with the public exchange key for the Tang server.

## Example thumbprint

<!-- image -->

1gYTN\_LpU9ZMB35yn5IbADY5OQ0

4.  Optional: In the Cluster details step of the user interface wizard, choose to enable Tang encryption on either the control plane nodes, workers, or both. You will be required to enter URLs and thumbprints for the Tang servers.
5.  Optional: Using the API, follow the "Modifying hosts" procedure.
- a.  Refresh the API token:

<!-- image -->

$ source refresh-token b.  Set the

disk\_encryption.enable\_on setting to

, or workers

. Set the

- b.  Set the disk\_encryption.enable\_on setting to all , masters , or workers . Set the disk\_encryption.mode setting to tang . Set disk\_encyrption.tang\_servers to provide the URL and thumbprint details about one or more Tang servers:

```
$ curl https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/clusters/${CLUSTER_ID} \ -X PATCH \ -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d ' { "disk_encryption": { "enable_on": "all", "mode": "tang", "tang_servers": " [{\"url\":\"http://tang.example.com:7500\",\"thumbprint\":\"PLjNyRdGw03zlRoGjQYMahSZG u9\"}, {\"url\":\"http://tang2.example.com:7500\",\"thumbprint\":\"XYjNyRdGw03zlRoGjQYMahSZ Gu3\"}]" } } ' | jq
```

Valid settings for enable\_on are all , master , worker , or none . Within the tang\_servers value, comment out the quotes within the object(s).

## 6.3. ADDITIONAL RESOURCES

- Modifying hosts

## CHAPTER 7. CONFIGURING THE DISCOVERY IMAGE

The Assisted Installer uses an initial image to run an agent that performs hardware and network validations before attempting to install OpenShift Container Platform. You can use Ignition to customize the discovery image.

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

Modifications to the discovery image will not persist in the system.

## 7.1. CREATING AN IGNITION CONFIGURATION FILE

Ignition is a low-level system configuration utility, which is part of the temporary initial root filesystem, the initramfs . When Ignition runs on the first boot, it finds configuration data in the Ignition configuration file and applies it to the host before switch\_root is called to pivot to the host's root filesystem.

Ignition uses a JSON configuration specification file to represent the set of changes that occur on the first boot.

<!-- image -->

## IMPORTANT

Ignition versions newer than 3.2 are not supported, and will raise an error.

## Procedure

1.  Create an Ignition file and specify the configuration specification version:
2.  Add configuration data to the Ignition file. For example, add a password to the core user.
- a.  Generate a password hash:

```
$ vim ~/ignition.conf { "ignition": { "version": "3.1.0" } }
```

$ openssl passwd -6

- b.  Add the generated password hash to the core user:

```
{ "ignition": { "version": "3.1.0" }, "passwd": { "users": [ { "name": "core", "passwordHash": "$6$spam$M5LGSMGyVD.9XOboxcwrsnwNdF4irpJdAWy.1Ry55syyUiUssIzIAHaOrUHr2z g6ruD8YNBPW9kW0H8EnKXyc1" }
```

<!-- image -->

3.  Save the Ignition file and export it to the IGNITION\_FILE variable:

$ export IGNITION\_FILE=~/ignition.conf

## 7.2. MODIFYING THE DISCOVERY IMAGE WITH IGNITION

Once you create an Ignition configuration file, you can modify the discovery image by patching the infrastructure environment using the Assisted Installer API.

## Prerequisites

- If you used the web console to create the cluster, you have set up the API authentication.
- You have an infrastructure environment and you have exported the infrastructure environment id to the INFRA\_ENV\_ID variable.
- You have a valid Ignition file and have exported the file name as $IGNITION\_FILE .

## Procedure

1.  Create an ignition\_config\_override JSON object and redirect it to a file:
2.  Refresh the API token:

```
$ jq -n \ --arg IGNITION "$(jq -c . $IGNITION_FILE)" \ '{ignition_config_override: $IGNITION}' \ > discovery_ignition.json
```

$ source refresh-token

3.  Patch the infrastructure environment:

```
$ curl \ --header "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \ --header "Content-Type: application/json" \ -XPATCH \ -d @discovery_ignition.json \ https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/infra-envs/$INFRA_ENV_ID | jq
```

The ignition\_config\_override object references the Ignition file.

4.  Download the updated discovery image.

## CHAPTER 8. BOOTING HOSTS WITH THE DISCOVERY IMAGE

The Assisted Installer uses an initial image to run an agent that performs hardware and network validations before attempting to install OpenShift Container Platform. You can boot hosts with the discovery image using three methods:

- USB drive
- Redfish virtual media
- iPXE

## 8.1. CREATING AN ISO IMAGE ON A USB DRIVE

You can install the Assisted Installer agent using a USB drive that contains the discovery ISO image. Starting the host with the USB drive prepares the host for the software installation.

## Procedure

1.  On the administration host, insert a USB drive into a USB port.
2.  Copy the ISO image to the USB drive, for example:

<!-- image -->

# dd if=&lt;path\_to\_iso&gt; of=&lt;path\_to\_usb&gt; status=progress where:

## &lt;path\_to\_iso&gt;

is the relative path to the downloaded discovery ISO file, for example, discovery.iso .

## &lt;path\_to\_usb&gt;

is the location of the connected USB drive, for example, /dev/sdb . After the ISO is copied to the USB drive, you can use the USB drive to install the Assisted

Installer agent on the cluster host.

## 8.2. BOOTING WITH A USB DRIVE

To register nodes with the Assisted Installer using a bootable USB drive, use the following procedure.

## Procedure

1.  Insert the RHCOS discovery ISO USB drive into the target host.
2.  Configure the boot drive order in the server firmware settings to boot from the attached discovery ISO, and then reboot the server.
3.  Wait for the host to boot up.
- a.  For web console installations, on the administration host, return to the browser. Wait for the host to appear in the list of discovered hosts.
- b.  For API installations, refresh the token, check the enabled host count, and gather the host IDs:

$ source refresh-token

```
$ curl -s -X GET "https://api.openshift.com/api/assistedinstall/v2/clusters/$CLUSTER_ID" \ --header "Content-Type: application/json" \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \ | jq '.enabled_host_count'
```

```
$ curl -s -X GET "https://api.openshift.com/api/assistedinstall/v2/clusters/$CLUSTER_ID" \ --header "Content-Type: application/json" \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \ | jq '.host_networks[].host_ids'
```

## Example output

```
[ "1062663e-7989-8b2d-7fbb-e6f4d5bb28e5" ]
```

## 8.3. BOOTING FROM AN HTTP-HOSTED ISO IMAGE USING THE REDFISH API

You can provision hosts in your network using ISOs that you install using the Redfish Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) API.

## Prerequisites

- Download the installation Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) ISO.

## Procedure

1.  Copy the ISO file to an HTTP server accessible in your network.
2.  Boot the host from the hosted ISO file, for example:
- a.  Call the redfish API to set the hosted ISO as the VirtualMedia boot media by running the following command:

```
$ curl -k -u <bmc_username>:<bmc_password> \ -d '{"Image":"<hosted_iso_file>", "Inserted": true}' \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -X POST
```

```
<host_bmc_address>/redfish/v1/Managers/iDRAC.Embedded.1/VirtualMedia/CD/Actions/Vi rtualMedia.InsertMedia
```

Where:

## &lt;bmc\_username&gt;:&lt;bmc\_password&gt;

Is the username and password for the target host BMC.

&lt;hosted\_iso\_file&gt;

https://example.com/rhcos-

Is the URL for the hosted installation ISO, for example:

Is the URL for the hosted installation ISO, for example: https://example.com/rhcoslive-minimal.iso . The ISO must be accessible from the target host machine.

## &lt;host\_bmc\_address&gt;

Is the BMC IP address of the target host machine.

- b.  Set the host to boot from the VirtualMedia device by running the following command:

$ curl -k -u &lt;bmc\_username&gt;:&lt;bmc\_password&gt; \

-X PATCH -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \ -d '{"Boot": {"BootSourceOverrideTarget": "Cd", "BootSourceOverrideMode": "UEFI", "BootSourceOverrideEnabled": "Once"}}' \ &lt;host\_bmc\_address&gt;/redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1

- c.  Reboot the host:

$ curl -k -u &lt;bmc\_username&gt;:&lt;bmc\_password&gt; \

-d '{"ResetType": "ForceRestart"}' \

-H 'Content-type: application/json' \

- -X POST

&lt;host\_bmc\_address&gt;/redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1/Actions/ComputerSystem.R eset

- d.  Optional: If the host is powered off, you can boot it using the {"ResetType": "On"} switch. Run the following command:

$ curl -k -u &lt;bmc\_username&gt;:&lt;bmc\_password&gt; \ -d '{"ResetType": "On"}' -H 'Content-type: application/json' \ -X POST &lt;host\_bmc\_address&gt;/redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1/Actions/ComputerSystem.R eset

## 8.4. BOOTING HOSTS USING IPXE

The Assisted Installer provides an iPXE script including all of the artifacts needed to boot the discovery image for an infrastructure environment. Due to the limitations of the current HTTPS implementation of iPXE, the recommendation is to download and expose the needed artifacts in an HTTP server. Currently, even if iPXE supports HTTPS protocol, the supported algorithms are old and not recommended.

The full list of supported ciphers is in https://ipxe.org/crypto.

## Prerequisites

- You have created an infrastructure environment by using the API or you have created a cluster by using the web console.
- You have your infrastructure environment ID exported in your shell as $INFRA\_ENV\_ID .
- You have credentials to use when accessing the API and have exported a token as $API\_TOKEN in your shell.

NOTE

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

If you configure iPXE by using the web console, the $INFRA\_ENV\_ID and $API\_TOKEN variables are preset.

- You have an HTTP server to host the images.

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

IBM Power® only supports PXE, which has the following requirements:

- GRUB2 installed at /var/lib/tftpboot
- DHCP and TFTP for PXE

## Procedure

1.  Download the iPXE script directly from the web console, or get the iPXE script from the Assisted Installer by running the following command:

```
$ curl \ --silent \ --header "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \ https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/infraenvs/$INFRA_ENV_ID/downloads/files?file_name=ipxe-script > ipxe-script
```

## Example

#!ipxe initrd --name initrd http://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-images/images/&lt;infra\_env\_id&gt;/pxeinitrd?arch=x86\_64&amp;image\_token=&lt;token\_string&gt;&amp;version=4.10 kernel http://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-images/boot-artifacts/kernel? arch=x86\_64&amp;version=4.10 initrd=initrd coreos.live.rootfs\_url=http://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-images/boot-artifacts/rootfs? arch=x86\_64&amp;version=4.10 random.trust\_cpu=on rd.luks.options=discard ignition.firstboot ignition.platform.id=metal console=tty1 console=ttyS1,115200n8 coreos.inst.persistentkargs="console=tty1 console=ttyS1,115200n8" boot

2.  Download the required artifacts by extracting URLs from the ipxe-script :
- a.  Download the initial RAM disk by running the following command:
- b.  Download the Linux kernel by running the following command:

```
$ awk '/^initrd /{print $NF}' ipxe-script \ | xargs curl -o initrd.img -L
```

$ awk '/^kernel /{print $2}' ipxe-script | xargs curl -o kernel -L

- c.  Download the root filesystem by running the following command:

$ grep ^kernel ipxe\_script | xargs -n1 | grep ^coreos.live.rootfs\_url | cut -d = -f 2,3,4 | xargs curl -o rootfs.img -L

3.  Change the URLs to the different artifacts in the ipxe-script to match your local HTTP server. For example:

#!ipxe set webserver http://192.168.0.1 initrd --name initrd $webserver/initrd.img kernel $webserver/kernel initrd=initrd coreos.live.rootfs\_url=$webserver/rootfs.img random.trust\_cpu=on rd.luks.options=discard ignition.firstboot ignition.platform.id=metal console=tty1 console=ttyS1,115200n8 coreos.inst.persistent-kargs="console=tty1 console=ttyS1,115200n8" boot

4.  Optional: When installing with RHEL KVM on IBM Z® you must boot the host by specifying additional kernel arguments:

random.trust\_cpu=on rd.luks.options=discard ignition.firstboot ignition.platform.id=metal console=tty1 console=ttyS1,115200n8 coreos.inst.persistent-kargs="console=tty1 console=ttyS1,115200n8

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

When you install with iPXE on RHEL KVM, the VMs on the VM host might not start on the first boot. You must start them manually.

5.  Optional: When installing on IBM Power® you must download the initramfs , kernel , and root images as follows:
- a.  Copy the initrd.img and kernel.img images to the /var/lib/tftpboot/rhcos PXE directory.
- b.  Copy the rootfs.img to the /var/www/html/install HTTPD directory.
- c.  Add the following entry to the /var/lib/tftpboot/boot/grub2/grub.cfg directory:

```
if [ ${net_default_mac} == fa:1d:67:35:13:20 ]; then default=0 fallback=1 timeout=1 menuentry "CoreOS (BIOS)" { echo "Loading kernel" linux "/rhcos/kernel.img" ip=dhcp rd.neednet=1 ignition.platform.id=metal ignition.firstboot coreos.live.rootfs_url=http://9.114.98.8:8000/install/rootfs.img echo "Loading initrd" initrd "/rhcos/initrd.img" } fi
```

## CHAPTER 9. ASSIGNING ROLES TO HOSTS

You can assign roles to your discovered hosts. These roles define the function of the host within the cluster. The roles can be one of the standard Kubernetes types: control plane (master) or worker .

The host must meet the minimum requirements for the role you selected. You can find the hardware requirements by referring to the Prerequisites section of this document or using the preflight requirement API.

If you do not select a role, the system selects one for you. You can change the role at any time before installation starts.

## 9.1. SELECTING A ROLE BY USING THE WEB CONSOLE

You can select a role after the host finishes its discovery.

## Procedure

1.  Go to the Host Discovery tab and scroll down to the Host Inventory table.
2.  Select the Auto-assign drop-down for the required host.
3.  Select Control plane node to assign this host a control plane role.
4.  Select Worker to assign this host a worker role.
5.  Check the validation status.

## 9.2. SELECTING A ROLE BY USING THE API

You can select a role for the host by using the /v2/infra-envs/{infra\_env\_id}/hosts/{host\_id} endpoint. A host can have one of the following roles:

- master : A host with the master role operates as a control plane node.
- worker : A host with the worker role operates as a worker node.

By default, the Assisted Installer sets a host to auto-assign , which means the Assisted Installer will determine whether the host is a master or worker role automatically. Use this procedure to set the host's role.

## Prerequisites

- You have added hosts to the cluster.

## Procedure

1.  Refresh the API token:
2. $ source refresh-token
2.  Get the host IDs:

$ curl -s -X GET "https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/clusters/$CLUSTER\_ID" \

```
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \ | jq '.host_networks[].host_ids'
```

## Example output

```
[ "1062663e-7989-8b2d-7fbb-e6f4d5bb28e5" ]
```

3.  Modify the host\_role setting:

```
$ curl https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/infraenvs/${INFRA_ENV_ID}/hosts/<host_id> \ -X PATCH \ -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d ' { "host_role":"worker" } ' | jq
```

Replace &lt;host\_id&gt; with the ID of the host.

## 9.3. AUTO-ASSIGNING ROLES

Assisted Installer selects a role automatically for hosts if you do not assign a role yourself. The role selection mechanism factors the host's memory, CPU, and disk space. It aims to assign a control plane role to the weakest hosts that meet the minimum requirements for control plane nodes. The number of control planes you specify in the cluster definition determines the number of control plane nodes that the Assisted Installer assigns. For details, see Setting the cluster details.

All other hosts default to worker nodes. The goal is to provide enough resources to run the control plane and reserve the more capacity-intensive hosts for running the actual workloads. You can override the auto-assign decision at any time before installation. The validations make sure that the auto selection is a valid one.

## 9.4. ADDITIONAL RESOURCES

Prerequisites

## CHAPTER 10. PREINSTALLATION VALIDATIONS

## 10.1. DEFINITION OF PREINSTALLATION VALIDATIONS

The Assisted Installer aims to make cluster installation as simple, efficient, and error-free as possible. The Assisted Installer performs validation checks on the configuration and the gathered telemetry before starting an installation.

The Assisted Installer uses the information provided before installation, such as control plane topology, network configuration and hostnames. It will also use real time telemetry from the hosts you are attempting to install.

When a host boots the discovery ISO, an agent will start on the host. The agent will send information about the state of the host to the Assisted Installer.

The Assisted Installer uses all of this information to compute real time preinstallation validations. All validations are either blocking or non-blocking to the installation.

## 10.2. BLOCKING AND NON-BLOCKING VALIDATIONS

A blocking validation will prevent progress of the installation, meaning that you will need to resolve the issue and pass the blocking validation before you can proceed.

A non-blocking validation is a warning and will tell you of things that might cause you a problem.

## 10.3. VALIDATION TYPES

The Assisted Installer performs two types of validation:

## Host

Host validations ensure that the configuration of a given host is valid for installation.

## Cluster

Cluster validations ensure that the configuration of the whole cluster is valid for installation.

## 10.4. HOST VALIDATIONS

## 10.4.1. Getting host validations by using the REST API

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

If you use the web console, many of these validations will not show up by name. To get a list of validations consistent with the labels, use the following procedure.

## Prerequisites

- You have installed the jq utility.
- You have created an Infrastructure Environment by using the API or have created a cluster by using the web console.

- You have hosts booted with the discovery ISO
- You have your Cluster ID exported in your shell as CLUSTER\_ID .
- You have credentials to use when accessing the API and have exported a token as API\_TOKEN in your shell.

## Procedures

1.  Refresh the API token:

$ source refresh-token

2.  Get all validations for all hosts:
3.  Get non-passing validations for all hosts:

```
$ curl \ --silent \ --header "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \ https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/clusters/$CLUSTER_ID/hosts \ | jq -r .[].validations_info \ | jq 'map(.[])'
```

```
$ curl \ --silent \ --header "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \ https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/clusters/$CLUSTER_ID/hosts \ | jq -r .[].validations_info \ | jq 'map(.[]) | map(select(.status=="failure" or .status=="pending")) | select(length>0)'

## 10.5. CLUSTER VALIDATIONS

## 10.5.1. Getting cluster validations by using the REST API

If you use the web console, many of these validations will not show up by name. To obtain a list of validations consistent with the labels, use the following procedure.

## Prerequisites

- You have installed the jq utility.
- You have created an Infrastructure Environment by using the API or have created a cluster by using the web console.
- You have your Cluster ID exported in your shell as CLUSTER\_ID .
- You have credentials to use when accessing the API and have exported a token as API\_TOKEN in your shell.

## Procedures

1.  Refresh the API token:

$ source refresh-token

2.  Get all cluster validations:
3.  Get non-passing cluster validations:

```
$ curl \ --silent \ --header "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \ https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/clusters/$CLUSTER_ID \ | jq -r .validations_info \ | jq 'map(.[])'
```

```
$ curl \ --silent \ --header "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
```

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 introduces the new apiVIPs and ingressVIPs settings to accept many IP addresses for dual-stack networking. When using dual-stack networking, the first IP address must be the IPv4 address and the second IP address must be the IPv6 address. The new settings will replace apiVIP and IngressVIP , but you must set both the new and old settings when modifying the configuration by using the API.

Currently, the Assisted Service can deploy OpenShift Container Platform clusters by using one of the following configurations:

- IPv4
- Dual-stack (IPv4 + IPv6 with IPv4 as primary)

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

OVN is the default Container Network Interface (CNI) in OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 and later releases. SDN is supported up to OpenShift Container Platform 4.14, but not for OpenShift Container Platform 4.15 and later releases.

## 11.1.1. Limitations

## 11.1.1.1. SDN

- The SDN controller is not supported with single-node OpenShift.
- The SDN controller does not support dual-stack networking.
- The SDN controller is not supported for OpenShift Container Platform 4.15 and later releases. For more information, see Deprecation of the OpenShift SDN network plugin  in the OpenShift Container Platform release notes.

## 11.1.1.2. OVN-Kubernetes

For more information, see About the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin .

## 11.1.2. Cluster network

The cluster network is a network from which every pod deployed in the cluster gets its IP address. Given that the workload might live across many nodes forming the cluster, it is important for the network

provider to be able to easily find an individual node based on the pod's IP address. To do this, clusterNetwork.cidr is further split into subnets of the size defined in clusterNetwork.hostPrefix .

The host prefix specifies a length of the subnet assigned to each individual node in the cluster. An example of how a cluster might assign addresses for the multi-node cluster:

- cidr: 10.128.0.0/14

```
clusterNetwork: hostPrefix: 23
```

Creating a 3-node cluster by using this snippet might create the following network topology:

- Pods scheduled in node #1 get IPs from 10.128.0.0/23
- Pods scheduled in node #2 get IPs from 10.128.2.0/23
- Pods scheduled in node #3 get IPs from 10.128.4.0/23

Explaining OVN-Kubernetes internals is out of scope for this document, but the pattern previously described provides a way to route Pod-to-Pod traffic between different nodes without keeping a big list of mapping between Pods and their corresponding nodes.

## 11.1.3. Machine network

Machine networks are IP networks that connect all the cluster nodes within OpenShift Container Platform.

The Assisted Installer supports a single machine network for most cluster installations. In such cases, the Assisted Installer automatically determines the appropriate machine network based on the API and Ingress virtual IPs (VIPs) that you specify.

The Assisted Installer supports two machine networks in the following scenarios:

- For dual stack configurations, the Assisted Installer automatically allocates two machine networks, based on the IPv4 and IPv6 subnets and the API and Ingress VIPs that you specify.
- For iSCSI boot volumes, the hosts are automatically connected over two machine networks: one designated for the OpenShift Container Platform installation and the other for iSCSI traffic. During the installation process, ensure that you select the OpenShift Container Platform network. Using the iSCSI network will result in an error for the host.

The Assisted Installer supports multiple machine networks for the "cluster-managed networking with a user-managed load balancer" network management type. When installing this network management type, you must manually define the machine networks in the API cluster definitions, with the following conditions:

- Each node must have at least one network interface in at least one machine network.
- The load balancer IPs (VIPs) should be included in at least one of the machine networks.

Currently, you can install cluster-managed networking with a user-managed load balancer using the Assisted Installer API only.

## 11.1.4. Single-node OpenShift compared to multi-node cluster

Depending on whether you are deploying single-node OpenShift or a multi-node cluster, different values are mandatory. The following table explains this in more detail.

| Parameter                | Single-node OpenShift    | Multi-node cluster with DHCP mode   | Multi-node cluster without DHCP mode   |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Required                 | Required                 | Required                            | clusterNetwork                         |
| Required                 | Required                 | Required                            | serviceNetwork                         |
| Auto-assign possible (*) | Auto-assign possible (*) | Auto-assign possible (*)            | machineNetwork                         |
| Forbidden                | Forbidden                | Required                            | apiVIP                                 |
| Forbidden                | Forbidden                | Required in 4.12 and                | apiVIPs                                |
| Forbidden                | Forbidden                | Required                            | ingressVIP                             |
| Forbidden                | Forbidden                | Required in 4.12 and                | ingressVIPs                            |

- (*) Auto assignment of the machine network CIDR happens if there is only a single host network. Otherwise you need to specify it explicitly.

## 11.1.5. Air-gapped environments

The workflow for deploying a cluster without Internet access has some prerequisites, which are out of scope of this document. You can consult the Zero Touch Provisioning the hard way Git repository  for some insights.

## 11.2. VIP DHCP ALLOCATION

The VIP DHCP allocation is a feature allowing users to skip the requirement of manually providing virtual IPs for API and Ingress by leveraging the ability of a service to automatically assign those IP addresses from the DHCP server.

If you enable the feature, instead of using api\_vips and ingress\_vips from the cluster configuration, the service will send a lease allocation request and based on the reply it will use VIPs accordingly. The service will allocate the IP addresses from the Machine Network.

Please note this is not an OpenShift Container Platform feature and it has been implemented in the Assisted Service to make the configuration easier.

IMPORTANT

<!-- image -->

## IMPORTANT

VIP DHCP allocation is currently limited to the OpenShift Container Platform SDN network type. SDN is not supported from OpenShift Container Platform version 4.15 and later. Therefore, support for VIP DHCP allocation is also ending from OpenShift Container Platform 4.15 and later.

## 11.2.1. Example payload to enable autoallocation

```
{ "vip_dhcp_allocation": true, "network_type": "OVNKubernetes", "user_managed_networking": false, "cluster_networks": [ { "cidr": "10.128.0.0/14", "host_prefix": 23 } ], "service_networks": [ { "cidr": "172.30.0.0/16" } ], "machine_networks": [ { "cidr": "192.168.127.0/24" } ] }
```

## 11.2.2. Example payload to disable autoallocation

```
{ "api_vips": [ { "ip": "192.168.127.100" } ], "ingress_vips": [ { "ip": "192.168.127.101" } ], "vip_dhcp_allocation": false, "network_type": "OVNKubernetes", "user_managed_networking": false, "cluster_networks": [ { "cidr": "10.128.0.0/14", "host_prefix": 23 } ], "service_networks": [ {
```

```
"cidr": "172.30.0.0/16" } ] }
```

## Additional resources

- Installer-provisioned infrastructure for a bare-metal installation  provides additional explanation of the syntax for the VIP addresses.

## 11.3. NETWORK MANAGEMENT TYPES

The Assisted Installer supports the following network management types:

## Cluster-managed networking

Cluster-managed networking is the default option for deploying OpenShift Container Platform clusters. It minimizes user intervention by automatically provisioning and managing key network components.

The main characteristics of cluster-managed networking are the following:

- Integrates automated load balancing and virtual routing for managing the Virtual IP (VIP) addresses to ensure redundancy.
- Automatically supports an extensive internal DNS (CoreDNS) for service discovery.
- Hosts all control plane nodes within a single, contiguous subnet, simplifying routing and connectivity within the cluster.
- Supports the installation of platform-specific features such as the Bare Metal Operator for bare metal.
- Available for clusters with three or more control plane nodes; not available for single-node OpenShift.

You can configure cluster-managed networking both the web console or API. If you do not define a network management type, the Assisted Installer applies cluster-managed networking automatically for highly available clusters.

## User-managed networking

User-managed networking allows customers with custom or non-standard network topologies to deploy OpenShift Container Platform clusters. It provides control and flexibility, allowing you to integrate OpenShift Container Platform with existing and complex network infrastructures. The main characteristics of user-managed networking are the following:

- Allows users to configure one or more external load balancers for handling API and Ingress IP addresses.
- Enables control plane nodes to span multiple subnets.
- Can be deployed on both single-node OpenShift and high-availability clusters.

You can configure user-managed networking in both the Assisted Installer web console or API.

## Cluster managed networking with a user-managed load balancer

Cluster-managed networking with a user-managed load balancer is a hybrid network management

Cluster-managed networking with a user-managed load balancer is a hybrid network management type designed for scenarios that require automated cluster networking with external control over load balancing.

This approach combines elements from both cluster-managed and user-managed networking. The main characteristics of this network management type are as follows:

- Allows users to configure one or more external load balancers for handling API and Ingress IP addresses.
- Automatically supports an extensive internal DNS (CoreDNS) for service discovery.
- Enables control plane nodes to span multiple subnets.
- Supports the installation of platform specific features such as the Bare Metal Operator for bare metal.
- Provides high fault tolerance and disaster recovery for the control plane nodes.

You can configure cluster-managed networking with a user-managed load balancer in the Assisted Installer API only.

<!-- image -->

## IMPORTANT

Cluster-managed networking with a user-managed load balancer is a Developer Preview feature only. Developer Preview features are not supported by Red Hat in any way and are not functionally complete or production-ready. Do not use Developer Preview features for production or business-critical workloads. Developer Preview features provide early access to upcoming product features in advance of their possible inclusion in a Red Hat product offering, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process. These features might not have any documentation, are subject to change or removal at any time, and testing is limited. Red Hat might provide ways to submit feedback on Developer Preview features without an associated SLA.

## 11.4. STATIC NETWORK CONFIGURATION

You may use static network configurations when generating or updating the discovery ISO.

## 11.4.1. Prerequisites

- You are familiar with NMState.

## 11.4.2. NMState configuration

The NMState file in YAML format specifies the desired network configuration for the host. It has the logical names of the interfaces that will be replaced with the actual name of the interface at discovery time.

## 11.4.2.1. Example of NMState configuration

```
dns-resolver: config: server: - 192.168.126.1 interfaces: - ipv4: address: - ip: 192.168.126.30 prefix-length: 24 dhcp: false enabled: true name: eth0 state: up type: ethernet - ipv4: address: - ip: 192.168.141.30 prefix-length: 24 dhcp: false enabled: true name: eth1 state: up type: ethernet routes: config: - destination: 0.0.0.0/0 next-hop-address: 192.168.126.1 next-hop-interface: eth0 table-id: 254
```

## 11.4.3. MAC interface mapping

MAC interface map is an attribute that maps logical interfaces defined in the NMState configuration with the actual interfaces present on the host.

The mapping should always use physical interfaces present on the host. For example, when the NMState configuration defines a bond or VLAN, the mapping should only contain an entry for parent interfaces.

## 11.4.3.1. Example of MAC interface mapping

```
mac_interface_map: [ { mac_address: 02:00:00:2c:23:a5, logical_nic_name: eth0 }, { mac_address: 02:00:00:68:73:dc, logical_nic_name: eth1 } ]
```

## 11.4.4. Additional NMState configuration examples

The following examples are only meant to show a partial configuration. They are not meant for use as-is, and you should always adjust to the environment where they will be used. If used incorrectly, they can leave your machines with no network connectivity.

## 11.5. APPLYING A STATIC NETWORK CONFIGURATION WITH THE API

You can apply a static network configuration by using the Assisted Installer API.

IMPORTANT

<!-- image -->

## IMPORTANT

A static IP configuration is not supported in the following scenarios:

- OpenShift Container Platform installations on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
- OpenShift Container Platform installations on iSCSI boot volumes.

## Prerequisites

1.  You have created an infrastructure environment using the API or have created a cluster using the web console.
2.  You have your infrastructure environment ID exported in your shell as $INFRA\_ENV\_ID .
3.  You have credentials to use when accessing the API and have exported a token as $API\_TOKEN in your shell.
4.  You have YAML files with a static network configuration available as server-a.yaml and serverb.yaml .

## Procedure

1.  Create a temporary file /tmp/request-body.txt with the API request:
2.  Refresh the API token:
3. $ source refresh-token
3.  Send the request to the Assisted Service API endpoint:

```
jq -n --arg NMSTATE_YAML1 "$(cat server-a.yaml)" --arg NMSTATE_YAML2 "$(cat serverb.yaml)" \ '{ "static_network_config": [ { "network_yaml": $NMSTATE_YAML1, "mac_interface_map": [{"mac_address": "02:00:00:2c:23:a5", "logical_nic_name": "eth0"}, {"mac_address": "02:00:00:68:73:dc", "logical_nic_name": "eth1"}] }, { "network_yaml": $NMSTATE_YAML2, "mac_interface_map": [{"mac_address": "02:00:00:9f:85:eb", "logical_nic_name": "eth1"}, {"mac_address": "02:00:00:c8:be:9b", "logical_nic_name": "eth0"}] } ] }' >> /tmp/request-body.txt
```

```
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -X PATCH -d @/tmp/request-body.txt \ -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \ https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/infra-envs/$INFRA_ENV_ID
```

## 11.6. CONVERTING TO DUAL-STACK NETWORKING

Dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 configuration allows deployment of a cluster with pods residing in both IPv4 and IPv6 subnets.

## 11.6.1. Prerequisites

- You are familiar with OVN-K8s documentation

## 11.6.2. Example payload for single-node OpenShift

```
{ "network_type": "OVNKubernetes", "user_managed_networking": false, "cluster_networks": [ { "cidr": "10.128.0.0/14", "host_prefix": 23 }, { "cidr": "fd01::/48", "host_prefix": 64 } ], "service_networks": [ {"cidr": "172.30.0.0/16"}, {"cidr": "fd02::/112"} ], "machine_networks": [ {"cidr": "192.168.127.0/24"},{"cidr": "1001:db8::/120"} ] }
```

## 11.6.3. Example payload for an OpenShift Container Platform cluster consisting of many nodes

```
{ "vip_dhcp_allocation": false, "network_type": "OVNKubernetes", "user_managed_networking": false, "api_vips": [ { "ip": "192.168.127.100" }, { "ip": "2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334" } ], "ingress_vips": [ { "ip": "192.168.127.101" },
```

```
{ "ip": "2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7335" } ], "cluster_networks": [ { "cidr": "10.128.0.0/14", "host_prefix": 23 }, { "cidr": "fd01::/48", "host_prefix": 64 } ], "service_networks": [ {"cidr": "172.30.0.0/16"}, {"cidr": "fd02::/112"} ], "machine_networks": [ {"cidr": "192.168.127.0/24"},{"cidr": "1001:db8::/120"} ] }
```

## 11.6.4. Limitations

The api\_vips IP address and ingress\_vips IP address settings must be of the primary IP address family when using dual-stack networking, which must be IPv4 addresses. Currently, Red Hat does not support dual-stack VIPs or dual-stack networking with IPv6 as the primary IP address family. Red Hat supports dual-stack networking with IPv4 as the primary IP address family and IPv6 as the secondary IP address family. Therefore, you must place the IPv4 entries before the IPv6 entries when entering the IP address values.

You can expand a cluster installed with the Assisted Installer by adding hosts using the user interface or the API.

## Additional resources

- API connectivity failure when adding nodes to a cluster
- Configuring multi-architecture compute machines on an OpenShift cluster

## 12.1. CHECKING FOR MULTI-ARCHITECTURE SUPPORT

You must check that your cluster can support multiple architectures before you add a node with a different architecture.

## Procedure

1.  Log in to the cluster using the CLI.
2.  Check that your cluster uses the architecture payload by running the following command:

$ oc adm release info -o json | jq .metadata.metadata

## Verification

- If you see the following output, your cluster supports multiple architectures:

```
{ "release.openshift.io/architecture": "multi" }
```

## 12.2. INSTALLING MULTI-ARCHITECTURE COMPUTE CLUSTERS

A cluster with an x86\_64 or arm64 control plane can support worker nodes that have two different CPU architectures. Multi-architecture clusters combine the strengths of each architecture and support a variety of workloads.

For example, you can add arm64 , IBM Power® ( ppc64le ), or IBM Z® ( s390x ) worker nodes to an existing OpenShift Container Platform cluster with an x86\_64 .

The main steps of the installation are as follows:

1.  Create and register a multi-architecture compute cluster.
2.  Create an x86\_64 or arm64 infrastructure environment, download the ISO discovery image for the environment, and add the control plane. An arm64 infrastructure environment is available for Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud (GC) only.
3.  Create an arm64 , ppc64le , or s390x infrastructure environment, download the ISO discovery images for arm64 , ppc64le , or s390x , and add the worker nodes.

## Supported platforms

For the supported platforms for each OpenShift Container Platform version, see About clusters with multi-architecture compute machines. Use the appropriate platforms for the version you are installing.

## Main steps

1.  Start the procedure for installing OpenShift Container Platform using the API. For details, see Installing with the Assisted Installer API in the Additional Resources section.
2.  When you reach the "Registering a new cluster" step of the installation, register the cluster as a multi-architecture compute cluster:
3. $ curl -s -X POST https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/clusters \ -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API\_TOKEN}" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d "$(jq --null-input \ --slurpfile pull\_secret ~/Downloads/pull-secret.txt ' { "name": "testcluster", "openshift\_version": "&lt;version-number&gt;-multi", 1 "cpu\_architecture" : "multi" 2 "control\_plane\_count": "&lt;number&gt;" 3 "base\_dns\_domain": "example.com", "pull\_secret": $pull\_secret[0] | tojson } ')" | jq '.id'

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

<!-- image -->

Use the multioption for the OpenShift Container Platform version

<!-- image -->

number; for example,

"4.18-multi"

.

Set the CPU architecture to "multi" .

Set the number of control plane nodes to "3", "4", or "5". The option of 4 or 5 control plane nodes is available from OpenShift Container Platform 4.18 and later. Single-node OpenShift is not supported for a multi-architecture compute cluster. The control\_plane\_count field replaces high\_availability\_mode , which is deprecated.

3.  When you reach the "Registering a new infrastructure environment" step of the installation, set cpu\_architecture to x86\_64 :
2. $ curl https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/infra-envs \ -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API\_TOKEN}" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d "$(jq --null-input \ --slurpfile pull\_secret ~/Downloads/pull-secret.txt \ --arg cluster\_id ${CLUSTER\_ID} ' { "name": "testcluster-infra-env", "image\_type":"full-iso", "cluster\_id": $cluster\_id, "cpu\_architecture" : "x86\_64" "pull\_secret": $pull\_secret[0] | tojson } ')" | jq '.id'

4.  When you reach the "Adding hosts" step of the installation, set host\_role to master :

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

For more information, see Assigning Roles to Hosts in Additional Resources .

$ curl https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/infra-

```
envs/${INFRA_ENV_ID}/hosts/<host_id> \ -X PATCH \ -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d ' { "host_role":"master" } ' | jq
```

5.  Download the discovery image for the x86\_64 architecture.
6.  Boot the x86\_64 architecture hosts using the generated discovery image.
7.  Start the installation and wait for the cluster to be fully installed.
8.  Repeat the "Registering a new infrastructure environment" step of the installation. This time, set cpu\_architecture to one of the following: ppc64le (for IBM Power®), s390x (for IBM Z®), or arm64 . For example:
9.  Repeat the "Adding hosts" step of the installation. This time, set host\_role to worker :

```
$ curl -s -X POST https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/clusters \ -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d "$(jq --null-input \ --slurpfile pull_secret ~/Downloads/pull-secret.txt ' { "name": "testcluster", "openshift_version": "4.12", "cpu_architecture" : "arm64" "control_plane_count": "3" "base_dns_domain": "example.com", "pull_secret": $pull_secret[0] | tojson } ')" | jq '.id'
```

-H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d ' { "host_role":"worker" } ' | jq
```

10.  Download the discovery image for the arm64, ppc64le or s390x architecture.
11.  Boot the architecture hosts using the generated discovery image.
12.  Start the installation and wait for the cluster to be fully installed.

## Verification

- View the arm64, ppc64le, or s390x worker nodes in the cluster by running the following command:

<!-- image -->

$ oc get nodes -o wide

## 12.3. ADDING HOSTS WITH THE WEB CONSOLE

You can add hosts to clusters that were created using the Assisted Installer.

<!-- image -->

## IMPORTANT

- Adding hosts to Assisted Installer clusters is only supported for clusters running OpenShift Container Platform version 4.11 and later.
- When adding a control plane node during Day 2 operations, ensure that the new node shares the same subnet as the Day 1 network. The subnet is specified in the machineNetwork field of the install-config.yaml file. This requirement applies to cluster-managed networks such as bare metal or vSphere, and not to usermanaged networks.

## Procedure

1.  Log in to OpenShift Cluster Manager and click the cluster that you want to expand.
2.  Click Add hosts and download the discovery ISO for the new host, adding an SSH public key and configuring cluster-wide proxy settings as needed.
3.  Optional: Modify ignition files as needed.
4.  Boot the target host using the discovery ISO, and wait for the host to be discovered in the console.
5.  Select the host role. It can be either a worker or a control plane host.
6.  Start the installation.
7.  As the installation proceeds, the installation generates pending certificate signing requests (CSRs) for the host. When prompted, approve the pending CSRs to complete the installation. When the host is successfully installed, it is listed as a host in the cluster web console.

IMPORTANT

<!-- image -->

## IMPORTANT

New hosts will be encrypted using the same method as the original cluster.

## 12.4. ADDING HOSTS WITH THE API

You can add hosts to clusters using the Assisted Installer REST API.

## Prerequisites

- Install the Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager CLI ( ocm ).
- Log in to Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager as a user with cluster creation privileges.
- Install jq .
- Ensure that all the required DNS records exist for the cluster that you want to expand.

<!-- image -->

## IMPORTANT

When adding a control plane node during Day 2 operations, ensure that the new node shares the same subnet as the Day 1 network. The subnet is specified in the machineNetwork field of the install-config.yaml file. This requirement applies to cluster-managed networks such as bare metal or vSphere, and not to user-managed networks.

## Procedure

1.  Authenticate against the Assisted Installer REST API and generate an API token for your session. The generated token is valid for 15 minutes only.
2.  Set the $API\_URL variable by running the following command:

<!-- image -->

$ export API\_URL=&lt;api\_url&gt;

<!-- image -->

- 1 Replace &lt;api\_url&gt; with the Assisted Installer API URL, for example,

https://api.openshift.com

<!-- image -->

3.  Import the cluster by running the following commands:
- a.  Set the $CLUSTER\_ID variable:
- i.  Log in to the cluster and run the following command:

<!-- image -->

$ export CLUSTER\_ID=$(oc get clusterversion -o jsonpath='{.items[].spec.clusterID}')

- ii.  Display the $CLUSTER\_ID variable output:

<!-- image -->

$ echo ${CLUSTER\_ID}

- b.  Set the $CLUSTER\_REQUEST variable that is used to import the cluster:

$ export CLUSTER\_REQUEST=$(jq --null-input --arg openshift\_cluster\_id "$CLUSTER\_ID" \

```
'{ "api_vip_dnsname": "<api_vip>", 1 "openshift_cluster_id": "<cluster_id>", 2 "name": "<openshift_cluster_name>" 3 }')
```

- 1 Replace &lt;api\_vip&gt; with the hostname for the cluster's API server. This can be the DNS domain for the API server or the IP address of the single node which the host can reach. For example, api.compute-1.example.com .
- 2 Replace &lt;cluster\_id&gt; with the $CLUSTER\_ID output from the previous substep.
- 3 Replace &lt;openshift\_cluster\_name&gt; with the plain text name for the cluster. The cluster name should match the cluster name that was set during the Day 1 cluster installation.
- c.  Import the cluster and set the $CLUSTER\_ID variable. Run the following command:

$ CLUSTER\_ID=$(curl "$API\_URL/api/assisted-install/v2/clusters/import" -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API\_TOKEN}" -H 'accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \ -d "$CLUSTER\_REQUEST" | tee /dev/stderr | jq -r '.id')

4.  Generate the InfraEnv resource for the cluster and set the $INFRA\_ENV\_ID variable by running the following commands:
- a.  Download the pull secret file from Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager at console.redhat.com.
- b.  Set the $INFRA\_ENV\_REQUEST variable:
4. 1 Replace &lt;path\_to\_pull\_secret\_file&gt; with the path to the local file containing the downloaded pull secret from Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager at console.redhat.com.
5. 2 Replace &lt;path\_to\_ssh\_pub\_key&gt; with the path to the public SSH key required to access the host. If you do not set this value, you cannot access the host while in discovery mode.
6. 3 Replace &lt;infraenv\_name&gt; with the plain text name for the InfraEnv resource.

```
export INFRA_ENV_REQUEST=$(jq --null-input \ --slurpfile pull_secret <path_to_pull_secret_file> \ 1 --arg ssh_pub_key "$(cat <path_to_ssh_pub_key>)" \ 2 --arg cluster_id "$CLUSTER_ID" '{ "name": "<infraenv_name>", 3 "pull_secret": $pull_secret[0] | tojson, "cluster_id": $cluster_id, "ssh_authorized_key": $ssh_pub_key, "image_type": "<iso_image_type>" 4 }')
```

<!-- image -->

Replace &lt;iso\_image\_type&gt; with the ISO image type, either full-iso or minimal-iso .

- c.  Post the $INFRA\_ENV\_REQUEST to the  /v2/infra-envs API and set the $INFRA\_ENV\_ID variable:

$ INFRA\_ENV\_ID=$(curl "$API\_URL/api/assisted-install/v2/infra-envs" -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API\_TOKEN}" -H 'accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' d "$INFRA\_ENV\_REQUEST" | tee /dev/stderr | jq -r '.id')

5.  Get the URL of the discovery ISO for the cluster host by running the following command:

$ curl -s "$API\_URL/api/assisted-install/v2/infra-envs/$INFRA\_ENV\_ID" -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API\_TOKEN}" | jq -r '.download\_url'

## Example output

https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-images/images/41b91e72-c33e-42ee-b80fb5c5bbf6431a? arch=x86\_64&amp;image\_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjE2NTYwMjYz NzEsInN1YiI6IjQxYjkxZTcyLWMzM2UtNDJlZS1iODBmLWI1YzViYmY2NDMxYSJ9.1EX\_VGaM NejMhrAvVRBS7PDPIQtbOOc8LtG8OukE1a4&amp;type=minimal-iso&amp;version=4.12

6.  Download the ISO:

<!-- image -->

$ curl -L -s '&lt;iso\_url&gt;' --output rhcos-live-minimal.iso

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Replace &lt;iso\_url&gt; with the URL for the ISO from the previous step.

7.  Boot the new worker host from the downloaded rhcos-live-minimal.iso .
8.  Get the list of hosts in the cluster that are not installed. Keep running the following command until the new host shows up:

$ curl -s "$API\_URL/api/assisted-install/v2/clusters/$CLUSTER\_ID" -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API\_TOKEN}" | jq -r '.hosts[] | select(.status != "installed").id'

## Example output

2294ba03-c264-4f11-ac08-2f1bb2f8c296

9.  Set the $HOST\_ID variable for the new host, for example:

<!-- image -->

$ HOST\_ID=&lt;host\_id&gt;

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- Replace &lt;host\_id&gt; with the host ID from the previous step.
10.  Check that the host is ready to install by running the following command:

NOTE

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

Ensure that you copy the entire command including the complete jq expression.

```
Example output $ curl -s $API_URL/api/assisted-install/v2/clusters/$CLUSTER_ID -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" | jq ' def host_name($host): if (.suggested_hostname // "") == "" then if (.inventory // "") == "" then "Unknown hostname, please wait" else .inventory | fromjson | .hostname end else .suggested_hostname end; def is_notable($validation): ["failure", "pending", "error"] | any(. == $validation.status); def notable_validations($validations_info): [ $validations_info // "{}" | fromjson | to_entries[].value[] | select(is_notable(.)) ]; { "Hosts validations": { "Hosts": [ .hosts[] | select(.status != "installed") | { "id": .id, "name": host_name(.), "status": .status, "notable_validations": notable_validations(.validations_info) } ] }, "Cluster validations info": { "notable_validations": notable_validations(.validations_info) } } ' -r { "Hosts validations": { "Hosts": [ { "id": "97ec378c-3568-460c-bc22-df54534ff08f", "name": "localhost.localdomain",

```

11.  When the previous command shows that the host is ready, start the installation using the /v2/infra-envs/{infra\_env\_id}/hosts/{host\_id}/actions/install API by running the following command:

$ curl -X POST -s "$API\_URL/api/assisted-install/v2/infraenvs/$INFRA\_ENV\_ID/hosts/$HOST\_ID/actions/install"  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API\_TOKEN}"

12.  As the installation proceeds, the installation generates pending certificate signing requests (CSRs) for the host.

<!-- image -->

## IMPORTANT

You must approve the CSRs to complete the installation.

Keep running the following API call to monitor the cluster installation:

```
$ curl -s "$API_URL/api/assisted-install/v2/clusters/$CLUSTER_ID" -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" | jq '{ "Cluster day-2 hosts": [ .hosts[] | select(.status != "installed") | {id, requested_hostname, status, status_info, progress, status_updated_at,
```

updated\_at, infra\_env\_id, cluster\_id, created\_at}

```
] }'
```

## Example output

"status\_info": "Host has rebooted and no further updates will be posted. Please check

```
{ "Cluster day-2 hosts": [ { "id": "a1c52dde-3432-4f59-b2ae-0a530c851480", "requested_hostname": "control-plane-1", "status": "added-to-existing-cluster", console for progress and to possibly approve pending CSRs", "progress": { "current_stage": "Done", "installation_percentage": 100, "stage_started_at": "2022-07-08T10:56:20.476Z", "stage_updated_at": "2022-07-08T10:56:20.476Z" }, "status_updated_at": "2022-07-08T10:56:20.476Z", "updated_at": "2022-07-08T10:57:15.306369Z", "infra_env_id": "b74ec0c3-d5b5-4717-a866-5b6854791bd3", "cluster_id": "8f721322-419d-4eed-aa5b-61b50ea586ae", "created_at": "2022-07-06T22:54:57.161614Z" } ] }
```

13.  Optional: Run the following command to see all the events for the cluster:

$ curl -s "$API\_URL/api/assisted-install/v2/events?cluster\_id=$CLUSTER\_ID" -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API\_TOKEN}" | jq -c '.[] | {severity, message, event\_time, host\_id}'

## Example output

14.  Log in to the cluster and approve the pending CSRs to complete the installation.

## Verification

- Check that the new host was successfully added to the cluster with a status of Ready :

$ oc get nodes

## Example output

```
NAME                           STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION control-plane-1.example.com    Ready    master,worker   56m   v1.25.0 compute-1.example.com          Ready    worker          11m   v1.25.0
```

## 12.5. REPLACING A CONTROL PLANE NODE IN A HEALTHY CLUSTER

You can replace a control plane (master) node in a healthy OpenShift Container Platform cluster that has three to five control plane nodes, by adding a new control plane node and removing an existing control plane node.

If the cluster is unhealthy, you must peform additional operations before you can manage the control plane nodes. See Replacing a control plane node in an unhealthy cluster  for more information.

## 12.5.1. Adding a new control plane node

Add the new control plane node, and verify that it is healthy. In the example below, the new node is node-5 .

## Prerequisites

- You are using OpenShift Container Platform 4.11 or later.
- You have installed a healthy cluster with at least three control plane nodes.
- You have created a single control plane node to be added to the cluster for Day 2.

## Procedure

1.  Retrieve pending Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) for the new Day 2 control plane node:

$ oc get csr | grep Pending

## Example output

```
csr-5sd59   8m19s   kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client-kubelet system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   <none> Pending csr-xzqts   10s     kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving                 system:node:node-5 <none>              Pending
```

2.  Approve all pending CSRs for the new node ( node-5 in this example):

<!-- image -->

$ oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}} {{end}}' | xargs --no-run-if-empty oc adm certificate approve

<!-- image -->

## IMPORTANT

You must approve the CSRs to complete the installation.

3.  Confirm that the new control plane node is in Ready status:

$ oc get nodes

## Example output

```
NAME       STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION node-0   Ready    master   4h42m   v1.24.0+3882f8f node-1   Ready    master   4h27m   v1.24.0+3882f8f node-2   Ready    master   4h43m   v1.24.0+3882f8f node-3   Ready    worker   4h29m   v1.24.0+3882f8f node-4   Ready    worker   4h30m   v1.24.0+3882f8f node-5   Ready    master   105s    v1.24.0+3882f8f
```

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

The etcd operator requires a Machine custom resource (CR) that references the new node when the cluster runs with a Machine API. The machine API is automatically activated when the cluster has three or more control plane nodes.

4.  Create the BareMetalHost and Machine CRs and link them to the new control plane's Node CR.
- a.  Create the BareMetalHost CR with a unique .metadata.name value:
- b.  Apply the BareMetalHost CR:

```
apiVersion: metal3.io/v1alpha1 kind: BareMetalHost metadata: name: node-5 namespace: openshift-machine-api spec: automatedCleaningMode: metadata bootMACAddress: 00:00:00:00:00:02 bootMode: UEFI customDeploy: method: install_coreos externallyProvisioned: true online: true userData: name: master-user-data-managed namespace: openshift-machine-api
```

<!-- image -->

$ oc apply -f &lt;filename&gt;

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Replace &lt;filename&gt; with the name of the BareMetalHost CR.

- c.  Create the Machine CR using the unique .metadata.name value:

```
apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1 kind: Machine metadata: annotations: machine.openshift.io/instance-state: externally provisioned metal3.io/BareMetalHost: openshift-machine-api/node-5 finalizers: - machine.machine.openshift.io labels: machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-cluster: <cluster_name> 1 machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machine-role: master machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machine-type: master name: node-5 namespace: openshift-machine-api spec: metadata: {} providerSpec: value: apiVersion: baremetal.cluster.k8s.io/v1alpha1 customDeploy: method: install_coreos hostSelector: {} image: checksum: "" url: "" kind: BareMetalMachineProviderSpec metadata: creationTimestamp: null userData: name: master-user-data-managed
```

1

Replace &lt;cluster\_name&gt; with the name of the specific cluster, for example, testday2-1-6qv96 .

To get the cluster name, run the following command:

$ oc get infrastructure cluster -o=jsonpath='{.status.infrastructureName}{"\n"}'

- d.  Apply the Machine CR:

$ oc apply -f &lt;filename&gt;

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Replace &lt;filename&gt; with the name of the Machine CR.

- e.  Link BareMetalHost , Machine , and Node by running the link-machine-and-node.sh script:
- i.  Copy the link-machine-and-node.sh script below to a local machine:

HOST\_PROXY\_API\_PATH="http://localhost:8001/apis/metal3.io/v1alpha1/namespace s/openshift-machine-api/baremetalhosts"

```

- ii.  Make the script executable:

$ chmod +x link-machine-and-node.sh

- iii.  Run the script:

<!-- image -->

$ bash link-machine-and-node.sh node-5 node-5

NOTE

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

The first node-5 instance represents the machine, and the second represents the node.

5.  Confirm members of etcd by executing into one of the pre-existing control plane nodes:
- a.  Open a remote shell session to the control plane node:

$ oc rsh -n openshift-etcd etcd-node-0

- b.  List etcd members:

# etcdctl member list -w table

## Example output

```

```

6.  Monitor the etcd operator configuration process until completion:

$ oc get clusteroperator etcd

## Example output (upon completion)

NAME   VERSION   AVAILABLE   PROGRESSING   DEGRADED   SINCE   MESSAGE etcd   4.11.5    True        False         False      5h54m

7.  Confirm etcd health by running the following commands:
- a.  Open a remote shell session to the control plane node:

$ oc rsh -n openshift-etcd etcd-node-0

- b.  Check endpoint health:

# etcdctl endpoint health

## Example output

```
192.168.111.24 is healthy: committed proposal: took = 10.383651ms 192.168.111.26 is healthy: committed proposal: took = 11.297561ms 192.168.111.25 is healthy: committed proposal: took = 13.892416ms 192.168.111.28 is healthy: committed proposal: took = 11.870755ms
```

8.  Verify that all nodes are ready:

$ oc get nodes

## Example output

```

## 12.5.2. Removing the existing control plane node

Remove the control plane node that you are replacing. This is node-0 in the example below.

## Prerequisites

- You have added a new healthy control plane node.

## Procedure

1.  Delete the BareMetalHost CR of the pre-existing control plane node:

$ oc delete bmh -n openshift-machine-api node-0

2.  Confirm that the machine is unhealthy:

$ oc get machine -A

## Example output

| NAMESPACE               NAME     PHASE     AGE   |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| openshift-machine-api   node-0   Failed    20h   |
| openshift-machine-api   node-1   Running   20h   |
| openshift-machine-api   node-2   Running   20h   |

| openshift-machine-api   node-4   Running   19h   |
| openshift-machine-api   node-5   Running   14h   |

3.  Delete the Machine CR:

$ oc delete machine -n openshift-machine-api node-0 machine.machine.openshift.io "node-0" deleted

4.  Confirm removal of the Node CR:

$ oc get nodes

## Example output

```
NAME      STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION node-1    Ready    master   20h   v1.24.0+3882f8f node-2    Ready    master   19h   v1.24.0+3882f8f

```

## 12.6. REPLACING A CONTROL PLANE NODE IN AN UNHEALTHY CLUSTER

You can replace an unhealthy control plane (master) node in an OpenShift Container Platform cluster that has three to five control plane nodes, by removing the unhealthy control plane node and adding a new one.

For details on replacing a control plane node in a healthy cluster, see Replacing a control plane node in a healthy cluster.

## 12.6.1. Removing an unhealthy control plane node

Remove the unhealthy control plane node from the cluster. This is node-0 in the example below.

## Prerequisites

- You have installed a cluster with at least three control plane nodes.
- At least one of the control plane nodes is not ready.

## Procedure

1.  Check the node status to confirm that a control plane node is not ready:

$ oc get nodes

## Example output

```
NAME      STATUS      ROLES    AGE   VERSION node-0    NotReady    master   20h   v1.24.0+3882f8f node-1    Ready       master   20h   v1.24.0+3882f8f node-2    Ready       master   20h   v1.24.0+3882f8f node-3    Ready       worker   20h   v1.24.0+3882f8f node-4    Ready       worker   20h   v1.24.0+3882f8f
```

2.  Confirm in the etcd-operator logs that the cluster is unhealthy:

$ oc logs -n openshift-etcd-operator etcd-operator deployment/etcd-operator

## Example output

E0927 08:24:23.983733       1 base\_controller.go:272] DefragController reconciliation failed: cluster is unhealthy: 2 of 3 members are available, node-0 is unhealthy

3.  Confirm the etcd members by running the following commands:
- a.  Open a remote shell session to the control plane node:

$ oc rsh -n openshift-etcd node-1

- b.  List the etcdctl members:

```
# etcdctl member list -w table
```

## Example output

```

```

4.  Confirm that etcdctl endpoint health reports an unhealthy member of the cluster:

# etcdctl endpoint health

## Example output

```

```

5.  Remove the unhealthy control plane by deleting the Machine custom resource (CR):

$ oc delete machine -n openshift-machine-api node-0

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

The Machine and Node CRs might not be deleted because they are protected by finalizers. If this occurs, you must delete the Machine CR manually by removing all finalizers.

6.  Verify in the etcd-operator logs whether the unhealthy machine has been removed:

$ oc logs -n openshift-etcd-operator etcd-operator deployment/ettcd-operator

## Example output

I0927 08:58:41.249222       1 machinedeletionhooks.go:135] skip removing the deletion hook from machine node-0 since its member is still present with any of: [{InternalIP } {InternalIP 192.168.111.25}]

7.  If you see that removal has been skipped, as in the above log example, manually remove the unhealthy etcdctl member:
- a.  Open a remote shell session to the control plane node:

$ oc rsh -n openshift-etcd node-1

- b.  List the etcdctl members:

# etcdctl member list -w table

## Example output

```

```

- d.  Remove the unhealthy etcdctl member from the cluster:

# etcdctl member remove 61e2a86084aafa62

## Example output

Member 61e2a86084aafa62 removed from cluster 6881c977b97990d7

- e.  Verify that the unhealthy etcdctl member was removed by running the following command:

# etcdctl member list -w table

## Example output

```

```

## 12.6.2. Adding a new control plane node

Add a new control plane node to replace the unhealthy node that you removed. In the example below, the new node is node-5 .

## Prerequisites

You have installed a control plane node for Day 2. For more information, see Adding hosts with

- You have installed a control plane node for Day 2. For more information, see Adding hosts with the web console or Adding hosts with the API.

## Procedure

1.  Retrieve pending Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) for the new Day 2 control plane node:

$ oc get csr | grep Pending

## Example output

csr-5sd59   8m19s   kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client-kubelet

```
system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   <none> Pending csr-xzqts   10s     kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving                 system:node:node-5 <none>              Pending
```

2.  Approve all pending CSRs for the new node ( node-5 in this example):

$ oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}} {{end}}' | xargs --no-run-if-empty oc adm certificate approve

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

You must approve the CSRs to complete the installation.

3.  Confirm that the control plane node is in Ready status:

$ oc get nodes

## Example output

```
NAME      STATUS    ROLES     AGE     VERSION node-1    Ready     master    20h     v1.24.0+3882f8f node-2    Ready     master    20h     v1.24.0+3882f8f node-3    Ready     worker    20h     v1.24.0+3882f8f node-4    Ready     worker    20h     v1.24.0+3882f8f node-5    Ready     master    2m52s   v1.24.0+3882f8f
```

The etcd operator requires a Machine CR referencing the new node when the cluster runs with a Machine API. The machine API is automatically activated when the cluster has three control plane nodes.

4.  Create the BareMetalHost and Machine CRs and link them to the new control plane's Node CR.

<!-- image -->

## IMPORTANT

Boot-it-yourself will not create BareMetalHost and Machine CRs, so you must create them. Failure to create the BareMetalHost and Machine CRs will generate errors in the etcd operator.

- a.  Create the BareMetalHost CR with a unique .metadata.name value:

```
apiVersion: metal3.io/v1alpha1 kind: BareMetalHost metadata: name: node-5 namespace: openshift-machine-api spec: automatedCleaningMode: metadata bootMACAddress: 00:00:00:00:00:02 bootMode: UEFI customDeploy: method: install_coreos externallyProvisioned: true online: true userData: name: master-user-data-managed namespace: openshift-machine-api
```

## b.  Apply the BareMetalHost CR:

<!-- image -->

$ oc apply -f &lt;filename&gt;

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Replace &lt;filename&gt; with the name of the BareMetalHost CR.

- c.  Create the Machine CR using the unique .metadata.name value:

```
apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1 kind: Machine metadata: annotations: machine.openshift.io/instance-state: externally provisioned metal3.io/BareMetalHost: openshift-machine-api/node-5 finalizers: - machine.machine.openshift.io labels: machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-cluster: test-day2-1-6qv96 machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machine-role: master machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machine-type: master name: node-5 namespace: openshift-machine-api spec: metadata: {} providerSpec: value: apiVersion: baremetal.cluster.k8s.io/v1alpha1 customDeploy: method: install_coreos hostSelector: {} image: checksum: "" url: "" kind: BareMetalMachineProviderSpec metadata:
```

```
creationTimestamp: null userData:
```

name: master-user-data-managed

## d.  Apply the Machine CR:

<!-- image -->

$ oc apply -f &lt;filename&gt;

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Replace &lt;filename&gt; with the name of the Machine CR.

- e.  Link BareMetalHost , Machine , and Node by running the link-machine-and-node.sh script:
- i.  Copy the link-machine-and-node.sh script below to a local machine:

```
#!/bin/bash # Credit goes to # https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1801238. # This script will link Machine object # and Node object.

## CHAPTER 13. INSTALLING ON NUTANIX

If you install OpenShift Container Platform on Nutanix, the Assisted Installer can integrate the OpenShift Container Platform cluster with the Nutanix platform, which exposes the Machine API to Nutanix and enables autoscaling and the dynamic provisioning of storage containers with the Nutanix Container Storage Interface (CSI).

<!-- image -->

## IMPORTANT

To deploy an OpenShift Container Platform cluster and maintain its daily operation, you need access to a Nutanix account with the necessary environment requirements. For details, see Environment requirements.

## 13.1. ADDING HOSTS ON NUTANIX WITH THE UI

To add hosts on Nutanix with the user interface (UI), generate the minimal discovery image ISO from the Assisted Installer. This downloads a smaller image that will fetch the data needed to boot a host with networking and is the default setting. The majority of the content downloads upon boot. The ISO image is about 100MB in size.

After this is complete, you must create an image for the Nutanix platform and create the Nutanix virtual machines.

## Prerequisites

- You have created a cluster profile in the Assisted Installer UI.
- You have a Nutanix cluster environment set up, and made a note of the cluster name and subnet name.

## Procedure

1.  In the Cluster details page, select Nutanix from the Integrate with external partner platforms dropdown list. The Include custom manifest checkbox is optional.
2.  In the Host discovery page, click the Add hosts button.
3.  Optional: Add an SSH public key so that you can connect to the Nutanix VMs as the core user. Having a login to the cluster hosts can provide you with debugging information during the installation.
- a.  If you do not have an existing SSH key pair on your local machine, follow the steps in Generating a key pair for cluster node SSH access .
- b.  In the SSH public key field, click Browse to upload the id\_rsa.pub file containing the SSH public key or drag and drop the file into the field from the file manager. To see the file in the file manager, select Show hidden files in the menu.
4.  Select the required provisioning type.

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

Minimal image file: Provision with virtual media downloads a smaller image that will fetch the data needed to boot.

5. In Networking , select Cluster-managed networking . Nutanix does not support User-managed networking .
- a.  Optional: If the cluster hosts are behind a firewall that requires the use of a proxy, select Configure cluster-wide proxy settings . Enter the username, password, IP address and port for the HTTP and HTTPS URLs of the proxy server.

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

The proxy username and password must be URL-encoded.

- b.  Optional: Configure the discovery image if you want to boot it with an ignition file. See Configuring the discovery image for additional details.
6.  Click Generate Discovery ISO .
7.  Copy the Discovery ISO URL .
8.  In the Nutanix Prism UI, follow the directions to upload the discovery image from the Assisted Installer.
9.  In the Nutanix Prism UI, create the control plane (master) VMs through Prism Central.
- a.  Enter the Name . For example, control-plane or master .
- b.  Enter the Number of VMs . This should be 3, 4, or 5 for the control plane.
- c.  Ensure the remaining settings meet the minimum requirements for control plane hosts.
10.  In the Nutanix Prism UI, create the worker VMs through Prism Central.
- a.  Enter the Name . For example, worker .
- b.  Enter the Number of VMs . You should create at least 2 worker nodes.
- c.  Ensure the remaining settings meet the minimum requirements for worker hosts.
11.  Return to the Assisted Installer user interface and wait until the Assisted Installer discovers the hosts and each of them have a Ready status.
12.  Continue with the installation procedure.

## 13.2. ADDING HOSTS ON NUTANIX WITH THE API

To add hosts on Nutanix with the API, generate the discovery image ISO from the Assisted Installer. Use the minimal discovery image ISO. This is the default setting. The image includes only what is required to boot a host with networking. The majority of the content is downloaded upon boot. The ISO image is about 100MB in size.

Once this is complete, you must create an image for the Nutanix platform and create the Nutanix virtual machines.

## Prerequisites

- You have set up the Assisted Installer API authentication.

- You have created an Assisted Installer cluster profile.
- You have created an Assisted Installer infrastructure environment.
- You have your infrastructure environment ID exported in your shell as $INFRA\_ENV\_ID .
- You have completed the Assisted Installer cluster configuration.
- You have a Nutanix cluster environment set up, and made a note of the cluster name and subnet name.

## Procedure

1.  Configure the discovery image if you want it to boot with an ignition file.
2.  Create a Nutanix cluster configuration file to hold the environment variables:

$ touch ~/nutanix-cluster-env.sh

$ chmod +x ~/nutanix-cluster-env.sh

If you have to start a new terminal session, you can reload the environment variables easily. For example:

$ source ~/nutanix-cluster-env.sh

3.  Assign the Nutanix cluster's name to the NTX\_CLUSTER\_NAME environment variable in the configuration file:

$ cat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt;&gt; ~/nutanix-cluster-env.sh export NTX\_CLUSTER\_NAME=&lt;cluster\_name&gt; EOF

Replace &lt;cluster\_name&gt; with the name of the Nutanix cluster.

4.  Assign the Nutanix cluster's subnet name to the NTX\_SUBNET\_NAME environment variable in the configuration file:

$ cat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt;&gt; ~/nutanix-cluster-env.sh export NTX\_SUBNET\_NAME=&lt;subnet\_name&gt; EOF

Replace &lt;subnet\_name&gt; with the name of the Nutanix cluster's subnet.

5.  Refresh the API token:

$ source refresh-token

6.  Get the download URL:

$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API\_TOKEN}" \ https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/infraenvs/${INFRA\_ENV\_ID}/downloads/image-url

7.  Create the Nutanix image configuration file:

```
$ cat << EOF > create-image.json { "spec": { "name": "ocp_ai_discovery_image.iso", "description": "ocp_ai_discovery_image.iso", "resources": { "architecture": "X86_64", "image_type": "ISO_IMAGE", "source_uri": "<image_url>", "source_options": { "allow_insecure_connection": true } } }, "metadata": { "spec_version": 3, "kind": "image" } } EOF
```

Replace &lt;image\_url&gt; with the image URL downloaded from the previous step.

8.  Create the Nutanix image:

```
$ curl  -k -u <user>:'<password>' -X 'POST' \ 'https://<domain-or-ip>:<port>/api/nutanix/v3/images \ -H 'accept: application/json' \ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \ -d @./create-image.json | jq '.metadata.uuid'
```

Replace &lt;user&gt; with the Nutanix user name. Replace '&lt;password&gt;' with the Nutanix password. Replace &lt;domain-or-ip&gt; with the domain name or IP address of the Nutanix plaform. Replace &lt;port&gt; with the port for the Nutanix server. The port defaults to 9440 .

9.  Assign the returned UUID to the NTX\_IMAGE\_UUID environment variable in the configuration file:
10.  Get the Nutanix cluster UUID:

```
$ cat << EOF >> ~/nutanix-cluster-env.sh export NTX_IMAGE_UUID=<uuid> EOF
```

```
$ curl -k -u <user>:'<password>' -X 'POST' \ 'https://<domain-or-ip>:<port>/api/nutanix/v3/clusters/list' \ -H 'accept: application/json' \ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \ -d '{ "kind": "cluster" }'  | jq '.entities[] | select(.spec.name=="<nutanix_cluster_name>") | .metadata.uuid'
```

Replace &lt;user&gt; with the Nutanix user name. Replace '&lt;password&gt;' with the Nutanix password.

Replace &lt;domain-or-ip&gt; with the domain name or IP address of the Nutanix plaform. Replace &lt;port&gt; with the port for the Nutanix server. The port defaults to 9440 . Replace &lt;nutanix\_cluster\_name&gt; with the name of the Nutanix cluster.

11.  Assign the returned Nutanix cluster UUID to the NTX\_CLUSTER\_UUID environment variable in the configuration file:

<!-- image -->

$ cat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt;&gt; ~/nutanix-cluster-env.sh export NTX\_CLUSTER\_UUID=&lt;uuid&gt; EOF

Replace &lt;uuid&gt; with the returned UUID of the Nutanix cluster.

12.  Get the Nutanix cluster's subnet UUID:

```
$ curl -k -u <user>:'<password>' -X 'POST' \ 'https://<domain-or-ip>:<port>/api/nutanix/v3/subnets/list' \ -H 'accept: application/json' \ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \ -d '{ "kind": "subnet", "filter": "name==<subnet_name>" }' | jq '.entities[].metadata.uuid'
```

Replace &lt;user&gt; with the Nutanix user name. Replace '&lt;password&gt;' with the Nutanix password. Replace &lt;domain-or-ip&gt; with the domain name or IP address of the Nutanix plaform. Replace &lt;port&gt; with the port for the Nutanix server. The port defaults to 9440 . Replace &lt;subnet\_name&gt; with the name of the cluster's subnet.

13.  Assign the returned Nutanix subnet UUID to the NTX\_CLUSTER\_UUID environment variable in the configuration file:

```
$ cat << EOF >> ~/nutanix-cluster-env.sh export NTX_SUBNET_UUID=<uuid> EOF
```

Replace &lt;uuid&gt; with the returned UUID of the cluster subnet.

14.  Ensure the Nutanix environment variables are set:

$ source ~/nutanix-cluster-env.sh

15.  Create a VM configuration file for each Nutanix host. Create three to five control plane (master) VMs and at least two worker VMs. For example:

```
$ touch create-master-0.json
```

```
$ cat << EOF > create-master-0.json { "spec": { "name": "<host_name>", "resources": { "power_state": "ON", "num_vcpus_per_socket": 1,
```

```
"num_sockets": 16, "memory_size_mib": 32768, "disk_list": [ { "disk_size_mib": 122880, "device_properties": { "device_type": "DISK" } }, { "device_properties": { "device_type": "CDROM" }, "data_source_reference": { "kind": "image", "uuid": "$NTX_IMAGE_UUID" } } ], "nic_list": [ { "nic_type": "NORMAL_NIC", "is_connected": true, "ip_endpoint_list": [ { "ip_type": "DHCP" } ], "subnet_reference": { "kind": "subnet", "name": "$NTX_SUBNET_NAME", "uuid": "$NTX_SUBNET_UUID" } } ], "guest_tools": { "nutanix_guest_tools": { "state": "ENABLED", "iso_mount_state": "MOUNTED" } } }, "cluster_reference": { "kind": "cluster", "name": "$NTX_CLUSTER_NAME", "uuid": "$NTX_CLUSTER_UUID" } }, "api_version": "3.1.0", "metadata": { "kind": "vm" } } EOF
```

Replace &lt;host\_name&gt; with the name of the host.

16.  Boot each Nutanix virtual machine:

```
$ curl -k -u <user>:'<password>' -X 'POST' \ 'https://<domain-or-ip>:<port>/api/nutanix/v3/vms' \ -H 'accept: application/json' \ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \ -d @./<vm_config_file_name> | jq '.metadata.uuid'
```

Replace &lt;user&gt; with the Nutanix user name. Replace '&lt;password&gt;' with the Nutanix password. Replace &lt;domain-or-ip&gt; with the domain name or IP address of the Nutanix plaform. Replace &lt;port&gt; with the port for the Nutanix server. The port defaults to 9440 . Replace &lt;vm\_config\_file\_name&gt; with the name of the VM configuration file.

17.  Assign the returned VM UUID to a unique environment variable in the configuration file:

```
$ cat << EOF >> ~/nutanix-cluster-env.sh export NTX_MASTER_0_UUID=<uuid>
```

EOF

Replace &lt;uuid&gt; with the returned UUID of the VM.

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

The environment variable must have a unique name for each VM.

18.  Wait until the Assisted Installer has discovered each VM and they have passed validation.

$ curl -s -X GET "https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/clusters/$CLUSTER\_ID"

--header "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $API\_TOKEN" | jq '.enabled\_host\_count'

19.  Modify the cluster definition to enable integration with Nutanix:

$ curl https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/clusters/${CLUSTER\_ID} \ -X PATCH \

-H "Authorization: Bearer ${API\_TOKEN}" \

-H "Content-Type: application/json" \

-d '

{

"platform\_type":"nutanix"

}

' | jq

20.  Continue with the installation procedure.

## 13.3. NUTANIX POSTINSTALLATION CONFIGURATION

Complete and validate the OpenShift Container Platform integration with the Nutanix cloud provider.

NOTE

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

By default, the installation program downloads and installs the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) image. If Prism Central does not have internet access, you can host the RHCOS image on any HTTP server and point the installation program to the image or you can use Prism Central to upload the image manually.

## 13.3.1. Updating the Nutanix configuration settings

After installing OpenShift Container Platform on the Nutanix platform by using the Assisted Installer, update the following Nutanix configuration settings manually.

## Prerequisites

- You have your Nutanix Prism Element username.
- You have your Nutanix Prism Element password.
- You have your Nutanix Prism storage container.
- The Assisted Installer has finished installing the cluster successfully.
- You have connected the cluster to console.redhat.com.
- You have access to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform command line interface.

## Procedure

1.  In the OpenShift Container Platform command line interface, update the Nutanix cluster configuration settings:

```
$ oc patch infrastructure/cluster --type=merge --patch-file=/dev/stdin <<-EOF { "spec": { "platformSpec": { "nutanix": { "prismCentral": { "address": "<prismcentral_address>", 1 "port": <prismcentral_port> 2 }, "prismElements": [ { "endpoint": { "address": "<prismelement_address>", 3 "port": <prismelement_port> 4 }, "name": "<prismelement_clustername>" 5 } ] }, "type": "Nutanix" } } } EOF
```

3.  When installing OpenShift Container Platform version 4.13 or later, update the Nutanix cloud provider configuration:
- a.  Get the Nutanix cloud provider configuration YAML file:

$ oc get cm cloud-provider-config -o yaml -n openshift-config &gt; cloud-provider-configbackup.yaml

- b.  Create a backup of the configuration file:

$ cp cloud-provider-config\_backup.yaml cloud-provider-config.yaml

- c.  Open the configuration YAML file:

$ vi cloud-provider-config.yaml

- d.  Edit the configuration YAML file as follows:
- e.  Apply the configuration updates:

```
kind: ConfigMap apiVersion: v1 metadata: name: cloud-provider-config namespace: openshift-config data: config: | { "prismCentral": { "address": "<prismcentral_address>", "port":<prismcentral_port>, "credentialRef": { "kind": "Secret", "name": "nutanix-credentials", "namespace": "openshift-cloud-controller-manager" } }, "topologyDiscovery": { "type": "Prism", "topologyCategories": null }, "enableCustomLabeling": true }
```

$ oc apply -f cloud-provider-config.yaml

## Example output

Warning: resource configmaps/cloud-provider-config is missing the kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration annotation which is required by oc apply. oc apply should only be used on resources created declaratively by either oc create -save-config or oc apply. The missing annotation will be patched automatically.

$ STARTING\_CSV=$(oc get packagemanifests nutanixcsioperator -o jsonpath=\ {.status.channels[*].currentCSV\})

- d.  Assign the catalog source for the subscription to a BASH variable:

$ CATALOG\_SOURCE=$(oc get packagemanifests nutanixcsioperator -o jsonpath=\ {.status.catalogSource\})

- e.  Assign the Nutanix CSI Operator source namespace to a BASH variable:

$ SOURCE\_NAMESPACE=$(oc get packagemanifests nutanixcsioperator -o jsonpath=\ {.status.catalogSourceNamespace\})

2.  Create the Nutanix CSI Operator YAML file using the BASH variables:

$ cat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; nutanixcsioperator.yaml apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1 kind: Subscription metadata: name: nutanixcsioperator namespace: openshift-cluster-csi-drivers spec: channel: $DEFAULT\_CHANNEL installPlanApproval: Automatic name: nutanixcsioperator source: $CATALOG\_SOURCE sourceNamespace: $SOURCE\_NAMESPACE startingCSV: $STARTING\_CSV EOF

3.  Create the CSI Nutanix Operator:

$ oc apply -f nutanixcsioperator.yaml

## Example output

subscription.operators.coreos.com/nutanixcsioperator created

4.  Run the following command until the Operator subscription state changes to AtLatestKnown . This indicates that the Operator subscription has been created, and might take some time.

$ oc get subscription nutanixcsioperator -n openshift-cluster-csi-drivers -o 'jsonpath= {..status.state}'

## 13.3.4. Deploying the Nutanix CSI storage driver

The Nutanix Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver for Kubernetes provides scalable and persistent storage for stateful applications.

For instructions on performing this step through the OpenShift Container Platform web console, see the Installing the CSI Driver using the Operator  section of the Nutanix CSI Operator documentation.

## Prerequisites

- You have installed the Nutanix CSI Operator.

## Procedure

1.  Create a NutanixCsiStorage resource to deploy the driver:

```
$ cat <<EOF | oc create -f apiVersion: crd.nutanix.com/v1alpha1 kind: NutanixCsiStorage metadata: name: nutanixcsistorage namespace: openshift-cluster-csi-drivers spec: {} EOF
```

## Example output

snutanixcsistorage.crd.nutanix.com/nutanixcsistorage created

2.  Create a Nutanix secret YAML file for the CSI storage driver:

```
$ cat <<EOF | oc create -f apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: ntnx-secret namespace: openshift-cluster-csi-drivers stringData: # prism-element-ip:prism-port:admin:password key:
```

&lt;prismelement\_address:prismelement\_port:prismcentral\_username:prismcentral\_password&gt;

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Replace these parameters with actual values while keeping the same format.

## Example output

```

## CHAPTER 14. INSTALLING ON VSPHERE

The Assisted Installer integrates the OpenShift Container Platform cluster with the vSphere platform, which exposes the Machine API to vSphere and enables autoscaling.

## 14.1. ADDING HOSTS ON VSPHERE

You can add hosts to the Assisted Installer cluster using the online vSphere client or the govc vSphere CLI tool. The following procedure demonstrates adding hosts with the govc CLI tool. To use the online vSphere Client, refer to the documentation for vSphere.

To add hosts on vSphere with the vSphere govc CLI, generate the discovery image ISO from the Assisted Installer. The minimal discovery image ISO is the default setting. This image includes only what is required to boot a host with networking. The majority of the content is downloaded upon boot. The ISO image is about 100MB in size.

After this is complete, you must create an image for the vSphere platform and create the vSphere virtual machines.

## Prerequisites

- You are using vSphere 7.0.2 or higher.
- You have the vSphere govc CLI tool installed and configured.
- You have set clusterSet disk.EnableUUID to TRUE in vSphere.
- You have created a cluster in the Assisted Installer web console, or
- You have created an Assisted Installer cluster profile and infrastructure environment with the API.
- You have exported your infrastructure environment ID in your shell as $INFRA\_ENV\_ID .

## Procedure

1.  Configure the discovery image if you want it to boot with an ignition file.
2. In Cluster details , select vSphere from the Integrate with external partner platforms dropdown list. The Include custom manifest checkbox is optional.
3. In Host discovery , click the Add hosts button and select the provisioning type.
4.  Add an SSH public key so that you can connect to the vSphere VMs as the core user. Having a login to the cluster hosts can provide you with debugging information during the installation.
- a.  If you do not have an existing SSH key pair on your local machine, follow the steps in Generating a key pair for cluster node SSH access .
- b.  In the SSH public key field, click Browse to upload the id\_rsa.pub file containing the SSH public key. Alternatively, drag and drop the file into the field from the file manager. To see the file in the file manager, select Show hidden files in the menu.
5.  Select the required discovery image ISO.

NOTE

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

Minimal image file: Provision with virtual media downloads a smaller image that will fetch the data needed to boot.

6. In Networking , select Cluster-managed networking or User-managed networking :
- a.  Optional: If the cluster hosts are behind a firewall that requires the use of a proxy, select Configure cluster-wide proxy settings . Enter the username, password, IP address and port for the HTTP and HTTPS URLs of the proxy server.

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

The proxy username and password must be URL-encoded.

- b.  Optional: If the cluster hosts are in a network with a re-encrypting man-in-the-middle (MITM) proxy or the cluster needs to trust certificates for other purposes such as container image registries, select Configure cluster-wide trusted certificates and add the additional certificates.
- c.  Optional: Configure the discovery image if you want to boot it with an ignition file. For more information, see Additional Resources .
7.  Click Generate Discovery ISO .
8.  Copy the Discovery ISO URL .
9.  Download the discovery ISO:

<!-- image -->

$ wget - O vsphere-discovery-image.iso &lt;discovery\_url&gt;

Replace &lt;discovery\_url&gt; with the Discovery ISO URL from the preceding step.

10.  On the command line, power off and delete any preexisting virtual machines:

$ for VM in $(/usr/local/bin/govc ls /&lt;datacenter&gt;/vm/&lt;folder\_name&gt;) do

/usr/local/bin/govc vm.power -off $VM

/usr/local/bin/govc vm.destroy $VM

done

Replace &lt;datacenter&gt; with the name of the data center. Replace &lt;folder\_name&gt; with the name of the VM inventory folder.

11.  Remove preexisting ISO images from the data store, if there are any:

<!-- image -->

$ govc datastore.rm -ds &lt;iso\_datastore&gt; &lt;image&gt;

Replace &lt;iso\_datastore&gt; with the name of the data store. Replace image with the name of the ISO image.

12.  Upload the Assisted Installer discovery ISO:

<!-- image -->

$ govc datastore.upload -ds &lt;iso\_datastore&gt;  vsphere-discovery-image.iso

Replace &lt;iso\_datastore&gt; with the name of the data store.

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

All nodes in the cluster must boot from the discovery image.

13.  Boot three to five control plane nodes:

$ govc vm.create -net.adapter &lt;network\_adapter\_type&gt; \

```
-disk.controller <disk_controller_type> \ -pool=<resource_pool> \ -c=16 \ -m=32768 \ -disk=120GB \ -disk-datastore=<datastore_file> \ -net.address="<nic_mac_address>" \ -iso-datastore=<iso_datastore> \ -iso="vsphere-discovery-image.iso" \ -folder="<inventory_folder>" \
```

```
<hostname>.<cluster_name>.example.com
```

See vm.create for details.

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

The foregoing example illustrates the minimum required resources for control plane nodes.

14.  Boot at least two worker nodes:

```
$ govc vm.create -net.adapter <network_adapter_type> \ -disk.controller <disk_controller_type> \ -pool=<resource_pool> \ -c=4 \ -m=8192 \ -disk=120GB \ -disk-datastore=<datastore_file> \ -net.address="<nic_mac_address>" \ -iso-datastore=<iso_datastore> \ -iso="vsphere-discovery-image.iso" \ -folder="<inventory_folder>" \ <hostname>.<cluster_name>.example.com
```

See vm.create for details.

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

The foregoing example illustrates the minimum required resources for worker nodes.

15.  Ensure the VMs are running:

<!-- image -->

$ govc ls /&lt;datacenter&gt;/vm/&lt;folder\_name&gt;

Replace &lt;datacenter&gt; with the name of the data center. Replace &lt;folder\_name&gt; with the name of the VM inventory folder.

16.  After 2 minutes, shut down the VMs:

```
$ for VM in $(govc ls /<datacenter>/vm/<folder_name>) do govc vm.power -s=true $VM done
```

Replace &lt;datacenter&gt; with the name of the data center. Replace &lt;folder\_name&gt; with the name of the VM inventory folder.

17.  Set the disk.EnableUUID setting to TRUE :

```
$ for VM in $(govc ls /<datacenter>/vm/<folder_name>) do govc vm.change -vm $VM -e disk.EnableUUID=TRUE done
```

Replace &lt;datacenter&gt; with the name of the data center. Replace &lt;folder\_name&gt; with the name of the VM inventory folder.

<!-- image -->

## NOTE

You must set disk.EnableUUID to TRUE on all of the nodes to enable autoscaling with vSphere.

18.  Restart the VMs:

```
$ for VM in $(govc ls /<datacenter>/vm/<folder_name>) do govc vm.power -on=true $VM done
```

Replace &lt;datacenter&gt; with the name of the data center. Replace &lt;folder\_name&gt; with the name of the VM inventory folder.

19.  Return to the Assisted Installer user interface and wait until the Assisted Installer discovers the hosts and each of them have a Ready status.
20.  Select roles if needed.
21. In Networking , clear the Allocate IPs via DHCP server checkbox.
22.  Set the API VIP address.
23.  Set the Ingress VIP address.
24.  Continue with the installation procedure.

## 14.3. VSPHERE POSTINSTALLATION CONFIGURATION USING THE WEB CONSOLE

After installing an OpenShift Container Platform cluster by using the Assisted Installer on vSphere with the platform integration feature enabled, you must update the following vSphere configuration settings manually:

- vCenter address
- vCenter cluster
- vCenter username
- vCenter password
- Data center
- Default data store
- Virtual machine folder

## Prerequisites

- The Assisted Installer has finished installing the cluster successfully.
- The cluster is connected to console.redhat.com.

## Procedure

1.  In the Administrator perspective, navigate to Home → Overview .
2.  Under Status , click vSphere connection to open the vSphere connection configuration wizard.
3.  In the vCenter field, enter the network address of the vSphere vCenter server. This can be either a domain name or an IP address. It appears in the vSphere web client URL; for example https://[your\_vCenter\_address]/ui .
4.  In the vCenter cluster field, enter the name of the vSphere vCenter cluster where OpenShift Container Platform is installed.

<!-- image -->

## IMPORTANT

This step is mandatory if you installed OpenShift Container Platform 4.13 or later.

5.  In the Username field, enter your vSphere vCenter username.
6.  In the Password field, enter your vSphere vCenter password.

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

The system stores the username and password in the vsphere-creds secret in the kube-system namespace of the cluster. An incorrect vCenter username or password makes the cluster nodes unschedulable.



7.  In the Datacenter field, enter the name of the vSphere data center that contains the virtual machines used to host the cluster; for example, SDDC-Datacenter .
8.  In the Default data store field, enter the vSphere data store that stores the persistent data volumes; for example, /SDDC-Datacenter/datastore/datastorename .

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

Updating the vSphere data center or default data store after the configuration has been saved detaches any active vSphere PersistentVolumes .



9.  In the Virtual Machine Folder field, enter the data center folder that contains the virtual machine of the cluster; for example, /SDDC-Datacenter/vm/ci-ln-hjg4vg2-c61657-t2gzr . For the OpenShift Container Platform installation to succeed, all virtual machines comprising the cluster must be located in a single data center folder.
10.  Click Save Configuration . This updates the cloud-provider-config file in the openshift-config namespace, and starts the configuration process.
11.  Reopen the vSphere connection configuration wizard and expand the Monitored operators panel. Check that the status of the operators is either Progressing or Healthy .

## Verification

The connection configuration process updates operator statuses and control plane nodes. It takes approximately an hour to complete. During the configuration process, the nodes will reboot. Previously bound PersistentVolumeClaims objects might become disconnected.

Follow the steps below to monitor the configuration process.

1.  Check that the configuration process completed successfully:
- a.  In the Administrator perspective, navigate to Home &gt; Overview .
- b.  Under Status click Operators . Wait for all operator statuses to change from Progressing to All succeeded . A Failed status indicates that the configuration failed.
- c.  Under Status , click Control Plane . Wait for the response rate of all Control Pane components to return to 100%. A Failed control plane component indicates that the configuration failed.

A failure indicates that at least one of the connection settings is incorrect. Change the settings in the vSphere connection configuration wizard and save the configuration again.

2.  Check that you are able to bind PersistentVolumeClaims objects by performing the following steps:
- a.  Create a StorageClass object using the following YAML:

kind: StorageClass apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1 metadata: name: vsphere-sc provisioner: kubernetes.io/vsphere-volume parameters: datastore: YOURVCENTERDATASTORE diskformat: thin reclaimPolicy: Delete volumeBindingMode: Immediate

- b.  Create a PersistentVolumeClaims object using the following YAML:

kind: PersistentVolumeClaim apiVersion: v1

metadata:

name: test-pvc namespace: openshift-config

annotations:

To troubleshoot a PersistentVolumeClaims object, navigate to Storage → PersistentVolumeClaims in the Administrator perspective of the OpenShift Container

## CHAPTER 15. INSTALLING ON ORACLE CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE (OCI)

From OpenShift Container Platform 4.14 and later versions, you can use the Assisted Installer to install a cluster on an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure virtual machine (VM) by using infrastructure that you provide. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provides services that can meet your needs for regulatory compliance, performance, and cost-effectiveness. You can access OCI Resource Manager configurations to provision and configure OCI resources.

From OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 and later versions, the integration between OpenShift Container Platform and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is certified on both virtual machines (VMs) and bare metal (BM) machines. Bare-metal installations using iSCSI boot drives require a secondary vNIC that is automatically created in the Terraform stack provided by Oracle.

For details and installation instructions, see Installing a cluster on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure by using the Assisted Installer in the OpenShift Container Platform documentation.

## CHAPTER 16. TROUBLESHOOTING

There are cases where the Assisted Installer cannot begin the installation or the cluster fails to install properly. In these events, it is helpful to understand the likely failure modes as well as how to troubleshoot the failure.

## 16.1. TROUBLESHOOTING DISCOVERY ISO ISSUES

The Assisted Installer uses an ISO image to run an agent that registers the host to the cluster and performs hardware and network validations before attempting to install OpenShift. You can follow these procedures to troubleshoot problems related to the host discovery.

Once you start the host with the discovery ISO image, the Assisted Installer discovers the host and presents it in the Assisted Service web console. See Configuring the discovery image for additional details.

## 16.1.1. Verify the discovery agent is running

## Prerequisites

- You have created an infrastructure environment by using the API or have created a cluster by using the web console.
- You booted a host with the Infrastructure Environment discovery ISO and the host failed to register.
- You have SSH access to the host.
- You provided an SSH public key in the "Add hosts" dialog before generating the Discovery ISO so that you can SSH into your machine without a password.

## Procedure

1.  Verify that your host machine is powered on.
2.  If you selected DHCP networking , check that the DHCP server is enabled.
3.  If you selected Static IP, bridges and bonds networking, check that your configurations are correct.
4.  Verify that you can access your host machine using SSH, a console such as the BMC, or a virtual machine console:

<!-- image -->

$ ssh core@&lt;host\_ip\_address&gt;

You can specify private key file by using the -i parameter if it is not stored in the default directory.

<!-- image -->

$ ssh -i &lt;ssh\_private\_key\_file&gt; core@&lt;host\_ip\_address&gt;

If you fail to connect over SSH to the host, the host failed during boot or it failed to configure the network.

Upon login you should see this message:

## Example login

<!-- image -->

If you are not seeing this message it means that the host did not boot with the Assisted Installer ISO image. Make sure you configured the boot order properly (The host should boot once from the live-ISO).

5.  Check the agent service logs:

<!-- image -->

$ sudo journalctl -u agent.service

In the following example, the errors indicate there is a network issue:

## Example agent service log screenshot of agent service log

<!-- image -->

If there is an error pulling the agent image, check the proxy settings. Verify that the host is connected to the network. You can use nmcli to get additional information about your network configuration.

## 16.1.2. Verify the agent can access the assisted-service

## Prerequisites

- You have created an Infrastructure Environment by using the API or have created a cluster by using the web console.
- You booted a host with the Infrastructure Environment discovery ISO and the host failed to register.
- You verified the discovery agent is running.

## Procedure

- Check the agent logs to verify the agent can access the Assisted Service:

<!-- image -->

$ sudo journalctl TAG=agent

The errors in the following example indicate that the agent failed to access the Assisted Service.

## Example agent log

Check the proxy settings you configured for the cluster. If configured, the proxy must allow access to the Assisted Service URL.

## 16.2. TROUBLESHOOTING MINIMAL DISCOVERY ISO ISSUES

Use the minimal ISO image when the virtual media connection has limited bandwidth. It includes only what the agent requires to boot a host with networking. The majority of the content is downloaded upon boot. The resulting ISO image is about 100MB in size compared to 1GB for the full ISO image.

## 16.2.1. Troubleshooting minimal ISO boot failure by interrupting the boot process

If your environment requires static network configuration to access the Assisted Installer service, any issues with that configuration might prevent the minimal ISO from booting properly. If the boot screen shows that the host has failed to download the root file system image, the network might not be configured correctly.

You can interrupt the kernel boot early in the bootstrap process, before the root file system image is downloaded. This allows you to access the root console and review the network configurations.

## Example rootfs download failure

## Procedure

1.  Add the .spec.kernelArguments stanza to the infraEnv object of the cluster you are deploying:

```
# ... spec: clusterRef: name: sno1 namespace: sno1 cpuArchitecture: x86_64 ipxeScriptType: DiscoveryImageAlways kernelArguments: - operation: append value: rd.break=initqueue 1 nmStateConfigLabelSelector: matchLabels: nmstate-label: sno1 pullSecretRef: name: assisted-deployment-pull-secret
```

rd.break=initqueue interrupts the boot at the dracut main loop. See  rd.break options for debugging kernel boot for details.

2.  Wait for the related nodes to reboot automatically and for the boot to stop at the iniqueue stage, before rootfs is downloaded. You will be redirected to the root console.
3.  Identify and change the incorrect network configurations. Here are some useful diagnostic commands:
- a.  View system logs by using journalctl , for example:
4. # journalctl -p err //Sorts logs by errors
5. # journalctl -p crit //Sorts logs by critical errors
6. # journalctl -p warning //Sorts logs by warnings
- b.  View network connection information by using nmcli , as follows:

# nmcli conn show

- c.  Check the configuration files for incorrect network connections, for example:

# cat /etc/assisted/network/host0/eno3.nmconnection

4.  Press control+d to resume the bootstrap process. The server downloads rootfs and completes the process.
5.  Reopen the infraEnv object and remove the .spec.kernelArguments stanza.

## 16.3. CORRECTING A HOST'S BOOT ORDER

Once the installation that runs as part of the Discovery Image completes, the Assisted Installer reboots the host. The host must boot from its installation disk to continue forming the cluster. If you have not correctly configured the host's boot order, it will boot from another disk instead, interrupting the installation.

If the host boots the discovery image again, the Assisted Installer will immediately detect this event and set the host's status to Installing Pending User Action .  Alternatively, if the Assisted Installer does not detect that the host has booted the correct disk within the allotted time, it will also set this host status.

## Procedure

- Reboot the host and set its boot order to boot from the installation disk. If you didn't select an installation disk, the Assisted Installer selected one for you. To view the selected installation disk, click to expand the host's information in the host inventory, and check which disk has the 'Installation disk' role.

## 16.4. RECTIFYING PARTIALLY-SUCCESSFUL INSTALLATIONS

There are cases where the Assisted Installer declares an installation to be successful even though it encountered errors:

- If you requested to install OLM operators and one or more failed to install, log in to the cluster's console to remediate the failures.
- If you requested to install more than two worker nodes and at least one failed to install, but at least two succeeded, add the failed workers to the installed cluster.

## 16.5. API CONNECTIVITY FAILURE WHEN ADDING NODES TO A CLUSTER

When you add a node to an existing cluster as part of Day 2 operations, the node downloads the ignition configuration file from the Day 1 cluster. If the download fails and the node is unable to connect to the cluster, the status of the host in the Host discovery step changes to Insufficient . Clicking this status displays the following error message:

The host failed to download the ignition file from &lt;URL&gt;. You must ensure the host can reach the URL. Check your DNS and network configuration or update the IP address or domain used to reach the cluster.

error: ignition file download failed.... no route to host

There are several possible reasons for the connectivity failure. Here are some recommended actions.

## Procedure

1.  Check the IP address and domain name of the cluster:
- a.  Click the set the IP or domain used to reach the cluster hyperlink.

b.  In the

Update cluster hostname window, enter the correct IP address or domain name for

- b.  In the Update cluster hostname window, enter the correct IP address or domain name for the cluster.
2.  Check your DNS settings to ensure that the DNS can resolve the domain that you provided.
3.  Ensure that port 22624 is open in all firewalls.
4.  Check the agent logs of the host to verify that the agent can access the Assisted Service via SSH:

$ sudo journalctl TAG=agent
